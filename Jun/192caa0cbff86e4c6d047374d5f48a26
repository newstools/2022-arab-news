Impact Oil & Gas prepares to sell stake in Namibian offshore block Impact Oil & Gas is considering selling its 20 percent stake in a large block in deep water off the coast of Namibia where TotalEnergies made a significant oil discovery this year, four industry sources told Reuters. Impact, which is privately owned and focused on exploration in Africa, has hired investment bank Jefferies to prepare a sale process for its stake in Block 2913B, which is estimated to be worth $500 million to $1 billion, the sources said. TotalEnergies, which operates the field, said in February it made the discovery in the Venus-X1 well, the second offshore find this year in the southern African country which hopes to become the continent’s newest oil producer. Impact Oil & Gas, whose investors include Toronto-listed Africa Oil and South Africa-based Hosken Consolidated Investments, declined to comment. “We are currently looking forward to participating in the Venus appraisal program later this year,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.
