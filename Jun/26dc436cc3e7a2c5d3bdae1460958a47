JEDDAH: It is not true that women in Saudi Arabia can show their hair or necks in civil status ID card photos, according to Mohammed Al-Jasser, spokesman for the civil status department in the Kingdom. The Council of Ministers has approved amendments to the regulations of the Civil Status system, with article 17 no more stating that “it is obligatory” for women to cover their hair and necks in photos for civil status ID cards. Al-Jasser told Arab News that only females between the ages of 10 and 14 years old can appear in ID photos with their hair uncovered, although he added that older women with certain health conditions might also be eligible for exemption. Meanwhile Article 146 has been amended to state that the national identification document, printed or digital, should contain the following information: the ID holder’s photo, first name, father’s name, grandfather’s name and family name/surname in both Arabic and English, place of birth, date of birth in Hijri and Gregorian format, civil registry number, ID expiry date in Hijri and Gregorian format, ID copy serial number, official logos, and security features, and any data the Ministry of Civil Status deems necessary to be added or deleted.
