LONDON: Saudi Arabia's climate envoy Adel Al-Jubeir called for an international response to confront climate change on Friday at the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF). Al-Jubeir, who is also Minister of State of Foreign Affairs, reaffirmed the Kingdom’s continued interest and commitment to cooperate with all international and regional partners to combat the impact of climate change and contribute to achieving global goals to create a better environment for future generations. He was heading the Kingdom's delegation participating in the MEF forum, which was opened by US President Joseph Biden. Delivering his statement via video, Al-Jubeir called for a serious, effective international response to the crisis, and mobilizing all efforts to confront the challenges of climate change. He also said the global response should take into account the special circumstances faced by the least developed countries, while supporting them to confront the negative effects of climate change policies, without impeding their sustainable development. He highlighted the Kingdom’s ongoing efforts in the field, along with its local, international and regional initiatives to confront climate challenges as part of its Vision 2030 objectives.
