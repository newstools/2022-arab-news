RIYADH: The Saudi Professional League on Sunday said that it would be postponing rounds 29 and 30 of the season until Thursday, June 23, and Monday, June 27. The decision to put back the last two rounds of the 2021-22 campaign was announced on the SPL’s official Twitter account after the Saudi Olympic team’s progress to the semi-finals of the 2022 AFC U-23 Asian Cup taking place in Uzbekistan. Prior to the decision, the 29th round was to have been played on Saturday, while the final matchday had been scheduled for June 23. The Saudi U-23 team reached the semi-final of the continental competition on Sunday night after beating Vietnam 2-0 in their last-eight clash at the Lokomotiv Stadium in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. Saad Al-Shehri’s team, which includes several players who are considered vital for their clubs, will now meet Australia on Wednesday with place in the final on June 19 up for grabs.
