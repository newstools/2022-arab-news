DUBAI: Rising Giants Network has partnered with audio equipment manufacturer Shure for its new campaign. Launched last week, the campaign “Tstahel Podcast” (Arabic for “You Deserve a Podcast”) is being rolled out across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt. RGN is calling on aspiring podcasters to pitch their ideas through Instagram Stories by tagging RGN and Shure and using the hashtag #RGNxShure. Commenting on the partnership with Shure, Basel Anabtawi, co-founder of RGN, said: “Shure is the absolute best podcasting mic; it only made sense for both worlds to come together and work on expanding the podcast scene in the region.” The campaign is currently targeted at only Arabic-speaking audiences. “We are focusing on Arabic shows at the moment because we want to build more high-quality and credible Arabic content for the region,” said Anabtawi. The deadline for entries is June 22, after which RGN and Shure will jointly assess the submissions and pick five winners. The winners will receive a customized microphone from Shure, and their show will be exclusively produced by RGN. Winners based in Dubai and Riyadh will be invited to record at the network’s studios. For those based outside these two cities, RGN will “work with them to record remotely as we have done with other podcasters,” Anabtawi said. “Nothing can stand in our way to create an awesome podcast. If there’s a problem, we think up a solution right away,” he added. The winners will be treated like any other podcaster under the RGN umbrella. Anabtawi said: “We will scrutinize the concept and the host and produce a piloting phase to ensure these are top-notch shows. If the show works according to our criteria, we will then push and promote it as we do with all other RGN shows.” He added: “It’s our mission to own MENA podcasting and we are doing all we can to make that happen.”
