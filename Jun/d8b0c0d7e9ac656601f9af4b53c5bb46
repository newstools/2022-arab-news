WASHINGTON: Australia’s Will Power held off American Alexander Rossi by one second to win the IndyCar Detroit Grand Prix on Sunday and seize the series season points lead. Power, who started 16th, passed US pole-sitter Josef Newgarden on lap 15 and stayed in front from there, denying the fast-closing Rossi his first triumph since 2019. “Chopped through the field then had to fight hard,” Power said. “Just drove it as straight as i could, really nice on the brakes and throttle. I knew if we could keep a decent gap we’d be all right.” New Zealand’s Scott Dixon was third with Newgarden fourth and Mexico’s Pato O’Ward fifth after 70 laps over a 2.35-mile, 14-turn temporary street course at Belle Isle Park. Power took his first victory since last year at the Indianapolis road course and moved atop the driver standings with 255 points, three ahead of Indianapolis 500 winner Marcus Ericsson. O’Ward was 12 back in third with defending season champion Alex Palou of Spain 14 back after seven of 17 races. “Very good performance from me mentally,” Power said. “I left nothing on the table. I was in that zone. That’s why I was able to pump out hot laps.” Rossi hasn’t won in 43 races since 2019 at Road America. “We’re finally just executing our potential,” Rossi said. “One more lap would have been really interesting.” Newgarden sped to the lead and kept it until Power overtook him on lap 15 with Dixon and Palou just behind. Rossi, who has signed a multi-year deal with McLaren starting next season, passed Palou on lap 39 to grab third and took second on a pit stop exchange with Dixon. Power made his final stop on lap 50 and returned to the track with the lead with Rossi in hot pursuit. The Aussie came up behind the slower car of Jack Harvey in the final laps but stayed ahead of Rossi to the finish.
