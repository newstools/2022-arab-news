CAIRO: The US-led coalition forces detained on Thursday a senior Daesh leader during an operation in Syria on June 16, a statement by the coalition said.
The US-led coalition earlier carried out an early-morning helicopter landing operation in a part of northern Syria held by Turkish-backed rebels, a spokesperson for the rebel group told Reuters, in what he said was the first raid of its kind in the area.
