VIENNA: The United States on Tuesday blamed Iran for both sides’ failure so far to reach an agreement on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, saying Iran’s demands on sanctions-lifting were preventing progress.
“What we need is a willing partner in Iran. In particular, Iran would need to drop demands for sanctions lifting that clearly go beyond the JCPOA and that are now preventing us from concluding a deal,” a US statement to a meeting of the UN nuclear watchdog’s Board of Governors said, referring to the 2015 deal by its name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
