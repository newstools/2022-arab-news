THUWAL: The King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) has formed a partnership with "Ocean Aero," a manufacturer of autonomous marine submarines. The goal of the collaboration is to improve university research in the Red Sea by bringing advanced scientific submarines to the Kingdom. “In response to the UN Ocean Decade and Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, KAUST is further dedicating itself to Red Sea research” said KAUST Director of Core Laboratories and Research Infrastructure, Daniel Acevedo Velez. He continued by saying that “This collaboration is just one of many of our efforts reflecting this goal. We are very excited to have Ocean Aero as partners, as not only their vehicles, but their shared expertise will significantly advance this project. “We couldn’t be happier to work alongside the oceanographers, researchers, and marine scientists at KAUST. By providing a platform to reach deeper into data collection in the Red Sea than ever before, we’re able to do more science for less resources in a safe, consistent, and reliable way” said Kevin Decker, CEO of Ocean Aero. The first stage of the KAUST-Ocean Aero collaboration began with the arrival of Triton submarines at the university. KAUST also intends to collaborate with Ocean Aero on training and operational tasks, allowing the university to make novel advances in ocean science and marine biology.
