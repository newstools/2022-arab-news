RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Supreme Court has called on all Muslims in the Kingdom to sight the Dhu Al-Hijjah crescent moon on Wednesday evening, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported. The sighting of the moon marks the beginning of the Islamic month of Dhu Al-Hijjah, during which the Hajj pilgrimage is performed, and is followed by Eid Al-Adha. The Supreme Court asked that anyone who sights the moon, whether with their own eyes or through a telescope, report to the nearest court and register their testimony. Moreover, whoever does sight the moon will join a moon sighting committee in Saudi Arabia, according to SPA. Hajj, one of Islam's five pillars, is the pilgrimage to Makkah in Saudi Arabia that every Muslim must make at least once in their lifetime if they are able.
