RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s main stock index struggled to regain momentum on Monday. Despite ending in green, it remained at one of its lowest levels since January. This was in response to aggressive interest rate hikes around the globe, leading to investors worrying about a potential recession.

Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait also retreated, while the Omani bourse advanced by 0.4 percent. Outside the Gulf, the Egyptian blue-chip index EGX30 extended losses to end the session 0.5 percent lower.
