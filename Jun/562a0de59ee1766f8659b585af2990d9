RIYADH: Siemens Energy is working toward exploring the possibilities of converting green energy into sustainable aviation fuel, as the entire world moves toward achieving the goal of net-zero by 2050, said a top official. While speaking at a virtual conference during the MEA Energy Week, Maria Ferraro, the chief financial officer of Siemens Energy, said: “It is important to commercialize the production of green hydrogen. We are now working together with our customers.” She also urged countries to remain well-positioned to move toward the common goal of decarbonization. Ferraro added: “Everyone has a role to play. We need to ensure that no country is left behind.” The official further noted that neither renewable energy nor the infrastructure surrounding it will be less expensive.
