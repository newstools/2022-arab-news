DUBAI: The Citizens of the World Refugee Choir performed at the UK’s Glastonbury Festival on Sunday. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle The choir, which was founded in 2015 in response to the Syrian refugee crisis, is made up of 50 people. A post shared by Citizens of the World Choir (@citizensoftheworldchoir) Becky Dell, the musical director, told PA that the choir is a 50/50 split of refugees and non-refugees, and calls itself a “rainbow tribe (because) none of us look the same as each other – it’s amazing.” She said the choir hopes to “elevate the narrative around refugees; too often the story is ‘poor refugees,’ it’s sending them far away. We wanted to show refugees in a different way. They are displaced human beings first and foremost.” A post shared by Citizens of the World Choir (@citizensoftheworldchoir) The choir opened the festival’s Avalon Stage on Sunday with a solo 40-minute set.
