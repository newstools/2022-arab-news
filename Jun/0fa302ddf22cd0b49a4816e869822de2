LONDON: Egyptian squash legend Mohamed El-Shorbagy has switched his allegiance to England, according to media reports. The former world number one in his sport is one of the most decorated squash players of all time, having spent 50 months at the top of the world rankings between 2014-2021. El-Shorbagy, 31, has lived in England since he was 15, and was crowned world champion in 2017. He is also a three-time British Open winner. “I'm really excited to be representing England now,” El-Shorbagy told BBC Sport. “I've lived in England more than half my life and have been trained by British coaches. “I came to study in England in 2006 and Bristol has become my home. As a British citizen now, I will give everything I can to a country that has supported me for so many years,” he added. During his long and illustrious career, El-Shorbagy has racked up 44 professional titles, putting him joint sixth on the all-time men's winners list. “We're committed to extending England's legacy as one of the most successful nations in squash and feel confident that adding a player of Mohamed's calibre will help to inspire and encourage current and future generations of English talent,” England Squash chief executive Mark Williams said. El-Shorbagy will make his debut for England in the Necker Mauritius Open, a PSA World Tour event, which takes place June 7 - 11, which will be followed by his debut at the British National Squash Championships in Manchester June 14 - 18. Reports said he will not competed at the upcoming Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, taking place July 28 to August 8.
