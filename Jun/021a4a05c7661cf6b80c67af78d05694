Saudi Arabia will provide a $30 million grant to support the Afghanistan Humanitarian Trust Fund, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) announced on Thursday. The grant comes as part of the Kingdom’s mission to alleviate the suffering of the Afghan people, SPA reported. It is also part of Saudi Arabia’s continued humanitarian and relief efforts to provide humanitarian aid to countries in need through the King Salman Humanitarian Aid & Relief Centre (KSrelief) and the Saudi Fund for Development, according to SPA. The grant was signed at KSrelief headquarters in Riyadh, in the presence of adviser at the Royal Court and General Supervisor of King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSrelief) and officials from the involved organizations, the SPA report added. Saudi Arabia has provided Afghanistan with aid valued at over $266 million, through donations and aid projects – including projects focused on health, education, and water and food security, according to SPA. The Afghanistan Humanitarian Trust Fund was established by the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) in March.
