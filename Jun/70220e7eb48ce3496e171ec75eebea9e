RIYADH: Tunisia on Thursday kicked off their qualifying campaign for the Africa Cup of Nations — to be held in Ivory Coast next year — with a comprehensive 4-0 home victory over Equatorial Guinea. The Carthage Eagles, African champions in 2004, now top Group J, level on three points with Libya — who beat Botswana 1-0 on Wednesday — but with a better goal difference while Equatorial Guinea and Botswana are still to get off the mark. Tunisia, playing their first competitive match since qualifying for the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar later this year, struggled to break the deadlock in the first half, which ended goalless, but the substitutions made by coach Jalel Kadri proved decisive after the break. Naim Saliti opened the scoring in the 56th minute, and Equatorial Guinea’s task became even more difficult when they had Joanet sent off in the 71st minute. Tunisia took advantage of the numerical advantage with substitutes Seifeddine Jaziri and Youssef Msakni adding the second and third goals, respectively, in the 77th and 80th minutes. Msakni capped off a comfortable night for Tunisia with his second goal in the 85th minute.
