DUBAI: The UAE reported 1,395 new daily coronavirus cases, the seventh day consecutive day that confirmed infections breached the 1,000-mark. There were no reported deaths, however, during the past 24 hours, leaving the country’s death toll unchanged at 2,305, the Ministry of Health and Prevention said in a report by state news agency WAM. The UAE’s COVID-19 caseload now stands at 921,566. The UAE has seen a steep spike in coronavirus infections over the previous days, which a health official attributed to some individuals flouting preventive regulations such as wearing masks in public and isolating after testing positive for COVID-19. Authorities have warned that the rule on wearing masks indoors remains in place, and would be strictly implemented with violators fined $816 (3,000 dirhams) for infractions of the rule. An additional 1,023 individuals fully recovered from COVID-19, bringing the total number of recoveries to 902,447, the health ministry said.
