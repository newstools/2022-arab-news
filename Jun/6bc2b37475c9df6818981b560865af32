DUBAI: A short clip showing a baby camel wandering inside a house has triggered wide reactions on social media.
Twitter account Camel Club in Saudi Arabia shared the video with a caption saying a little girl has fallen in love with the young dromedary and decided to raise it inside her family’s house.
The calf can be seen gingerly taking tentative steps as it roams inside the house and between furnitures. فتاة تربّي "حوار" في منزلها، بعد أن أحبّته وتعلّقت فيه !

One user wrote on Twitter that “the calf will eventually grow and it will no longer fit the door it entered from.”
Another user commented in Arabic saying: “He is unable to walk and there is no balance because of the parquet floor.”
“Raising animals is a blessing and a merciful act, much better than spending time playing internet games,” another one said.
