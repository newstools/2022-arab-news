RIYADH: Travelers entering Georgia from abroad no longer need a certificate of vaccination and a PCR test result upon arrival, the Saudi Embassy in Georgia said Thursday. “As of today, by a decree issued by the Government of Georgia; any person entering Georgia from abroad is exempted from the obligation to present a certificate of vaccination and a PCR test result,” the embassy tweeted. “This was done by amending Resolution No. 322 of the Government of Georgia issued on May 23, 2020 approving the rules of isolation and quarantine as a result of the outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic,” it added. The decree also stated that travelers are now exempt from self-isolation as was previously required. This decree comes after Saudi Arabia announced on Monday the lifting of measures that had been taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including the requirement to wear face masks in closed places. Proof of vaccination on the Tawakkalna app is no longer required to enter establishments, events, activities, airplanes and public transportation.
