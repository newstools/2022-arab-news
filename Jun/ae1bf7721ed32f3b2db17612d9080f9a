JEDDAH: With its relaxed family atmosphere, Jeddah Season’s The Village zone offers entertainment and education in equal measure. Children can participate in a variety of educational and recreational activities, such as the Al-Jahez experience, kids driving school and live shows, in a spirit of fun and happiness for family members. The Village provides free parking space and a wide range of services, with seven areas full of fun and recreational education, including the Al-Jahez experience, which introduces children to the oldest Arabic manuscripts detailing the animal kingdom through an educational and interactive exhibition. Robots also teach children about artificial intelligence and the development of robotics. The kids driving school teaches children how to drive on miniature roads, with each child given a driving license. The Village includes several recreational areas, such as the balloon ride and sports activities, as well as rock climbing, zip-lining and an obstacle course. Children can also visit the petting zoo, where they can play and take photos with the animals, and enjoy carnival skill games that offer challenges and prizes.
