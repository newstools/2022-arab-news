JEDDAH: A total of 297,444 applications have been registered in the electronic draw for citizens and residents inside the Kingdom for the 2022 Hajj season, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah said on Wednesday. According to the ministry, 62 percent of the applicants are men and 38 percent women. The 31-40 age group made up the highest percentage of total requests at 38 percent, followed by the 21-30 group with 23 percent, the 41-50 group with 21 percent and the 51-65 group with 12 percent. The lowest category was for those under 20. In a press release, the ministry said that more than 217,000 applications were made through the Eatmarna mobile app and electronic portal for domestic pilgrims. An SMS will be sent to those who qualified so that payment can be completed within 48 hours by approved payment methods. Deputy Minister of Hajj and Umrah Abdulfattah Mashat said that the electronic system sets several conditions in the selection process. Applicants should not be older than 65 and must be completely immunized according to the status in the Tawakkalna app. Only a small percentage of total requests were excluded, Mashat said. Reasons for exclusion centered on failure to meet the conditions or the mismatch of information with the applicant’s status. Verification of registered applications was carried out immediately after the deadline and the fulfillment of the conditions. Inquiries and suggestions can be sent via email: (care@Hajj.gov.sa), or the unified number 920002814, in addition to a customer service account for the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah on Twitter: (@MOHU_Care).
