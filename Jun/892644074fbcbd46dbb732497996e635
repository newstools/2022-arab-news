RIYADH: The Jeddah Central Development Co., wholly owned by the Public Investment Fund, has awarded a design contract for an oceanarium and coral farm landmark to US-based firm SOM. The oceanarium and coral farm will cement Jeddah’s position as a regional and global sustainable marine conservation leader. The phase 1 of master plan of the SR75 billion ($20.4 billion) Jeddah Central project includes four major landmarks — a museum, an opera house, a stadium, and an oceanarium, which includes a coral farm, and 10 recreational and touristic areas. “The signing of these contracts comes as part of our plans to develop a project that will contribute to the growth of the national economy and creation of jobs for Saudi nationals, all while providing Jeddah residents and visitors with a wide range of cultural and recreational destinations,” said Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz Al-Sulaim, CEO of JCDC. JCDC Chief Development Officer Paul O’Brien noted that construction of new landmarks will help attract local and global investments for the development and operation of the JCDC’s facilities.
