Tunisian star Ons Jabeur has risen to number four in the Women’s Tennis Association rankings, the highest position yet of her career, despite an early exit at the just-concluded French Open. Last month, Jabeur made history by becoming the first African or Arab player to win a WTA Masters 1000 event when she defeated Jessica Pegula of the US in the final of the Madrid Open. The 7-5, 0-6, 6-2 win saw the 27-year-old rise to number seven in the rankings; and a week later she lost the final of the Italian Open in Rome 6-2, 6-2 to world number one Iga Swiatek of Poland. Despite that loss, she entered Roland Garros as one of the title contenders. However, the sixth-seeded Tunisian suffered a 3-6, 7-6, 7-5 loss to Magda Linette of Poland in the first round. In 2021, Jabeur became the first Arab player to enter the women’s top 10.
