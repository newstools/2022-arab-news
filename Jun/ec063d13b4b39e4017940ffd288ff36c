RIYADH: Thailand is planning to negotiate with Saudi Arabia for the supply of fertilizers as the country is currently facing a shortage, especially due to the high cost of imports. The Thai Chamber of Commerce will coordinate with Saudi suppliers and a business event is to be held between three major Saudi-based fertilizer suppliers and Thai importers on June 29, Thai local media reported citing Commerce Minister Jurin Laksanawisit. Laksanawisit added that two Saudi suppliers were recently provided permission to sell fertilizers to Thailand. Thailand heavily relies on imports for its fertilizers, with only 8 percent coming from domestic sources and a usage of about 5 million tons of fertilizer a year, according to the minister. The country’s overall demand for fertilizer from Saudi Arabia is about 808,000 tons, the media report noted citing industry statistics.
