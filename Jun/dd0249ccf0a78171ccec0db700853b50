Dr. Alghamdi also emphasized SDAIA's global and national accomplishments, as well as the efforts of national experts, which have propelled the Kingdom to the forefront of technological and digital fields. Dr. Alghamdi stated that SDAIA's advanced infrastructure reflected the Kingdom's determination to achieve the Vision 2030 goals.Tawakkalna was launched by SDAIA to assist the government in combating COVID-19. The application managed the process of granting permits electronically during the curfew for government and private sector employees, as well as individuals, at the height of the pandemic. This aided in limiting the virus's spread. Tawakkalna then added pandemic-related services like health passport verification, COVID-19 test and vaccine services, reviewing health travel requirements, and managing travel requirements. SDAIA recently launched Tawakkalna Services, a secure digitally-enabled application that provides various e-services that facilitate all aspects of people's daily lives in Saudi Arabia.
