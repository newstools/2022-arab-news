The gongs were made up of two gold trophies in the categories for best corporate rebrand following a merger or acquisition, and best visual identity from the financial services sector, two silvers for best strategic or creative development of a new brand, and best brand consolidation, and a pair of bronze awards in the classes for best brand architecture solution, and best use of audio branding. The other big winner was Saffron Brand Consultants’ work for AD Ports Group, that collected five golds, one silver, and the grand prix award. Andrew Thomas, publisher of Transform magazine and founder of the Transform Awards MEA, described the MEA event as “a true celebration.” He said: “We are honoring great work by celebrating the transformative power of brand strategy and design. But also, after two years where the Transform Awards Middle East and Africa have been held with reduced numbers, travel embargoes, and general uncertainty we are now finally assembled, coming together to celebrate with our colleagues, our clients, and our peers.” The judging panel comprised of branding and communication experts, including Catherine Barr, brand strategy lead of brand and content marketing at WarnerMedia, Mohammed Fouad, TikTok’s head of brand marketing, Mahmoud Hassan, content and creative senior manager for PepsiCo’s Africa, Middle East, and South Asia sector, Oleg Nesterenko, chief growth officer with StarzPlay, and Anja Petrovski, marketing director at Audi Volkswagen Middle East.
