RIYADH: Saudi King Salman ordered state sectors to serve the pilgrims during Hajj to the best of their ability during a cabinet meeting he chaired at Al-Salam Royal Palace on Tuesday, Saudi news agency (SPA) reported. “Serving Hajj and Umrah pilgrims has been at the forefront of the Kingdom’s priority since its establishment and still is. We are proud to continue this mission with the highest competency,” King Salman said in a statement. Saudi Arabia earlier said it permitted over one million pilgrims from overseas to perform Hajj this year for the first time in two years of COVID-19 restrictions, which limited the pilgrimage to residents of the Kingdom. King Salman urged sectors to work according to the organizational and operational plans set in place for this year's pilgrimage to ensure a safe and spiritual Hajj experience. As of Sunday, a total of 282,523 pilgrims from all over the world arrived in Madinah for Hajj, authorities earlier reported. During the meeting, the cabinet was also briefed on the results of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s recent regional tour to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey.
