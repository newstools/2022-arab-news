ADEN: At least 10 Yemeni soldiers were killed and others wounded in two separate attacks in south Yemen believed to have been carried out by Al-Qaeda militants, state news agency Saba reported on Thursday, quoting a military official. The official said the attacks targeted army forces on duty in Abyan and Shabwa governates.
A convoy was ambushed by armed men overnight using roadside bombs in Abyan province, Saba reported, adding that three soldiers were killed and two other bodies were recovered.
A second attack targeted a military unit at a checkpoint in the southern town of Ateq in Shabwa province early on Wednesday, killing five soldiers, Saba said.
Several people were wounded in both attacks.
The attacks came amid an extended truce that has suspended air, sea and land attacks while allowing imports into Houthi-controlled seaports and a partial reopening of Sanaa airport.
The truce is the first comprehensive agreement in the conflict that has killed tens of thousands and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.
