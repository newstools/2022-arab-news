JEDDAH: More than 214,000 pilgrims from around the world had reached Madinah as of Thursday to perform Hajj, according to official figures. The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah said 189,447 people had landed at Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz International Airport since the start of the first Hajj flights, while 17,344 pilgrims had arrived in the city by land. A total of 130,308 pilgrims had already left Madinah and were on their way to the holy sites in Makkah, while 83,882 were still in the city, it said. The ministry said authorities in Madinah were working around the clock to ensure the best experience for visitors. Saudi Arabia is allowing up to 1 million people to join the Hajj this year, welcoming foreign pilgrims for the first time in two years, after COVID-19 restrictions meant the annual pilgrimage was limited to residents of the Kingdom. The General Presidency for the Affairs of the Two Holy Mosques recently launched its operational plan for this year’s Hajj season. It confirmed its readiness to receive pilgrims, saying it had mobilized 10,000 workers to serve them.
