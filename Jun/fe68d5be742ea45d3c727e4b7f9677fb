CAIRO: The Egyptian judiciary has issued a notification to Interpol to include six Muslim Brotherhood leaders on a “red notice” for smuggling funds abroad to finance terrorism. The Supreme State Security Criminal Court decided to notify Interpol in order to track the leaders, arrest them and hand them over to Egyptian authorities. The list includes former Secretary-General Mahmoud Hussein and Medhat Ahmed Al-Haddad, a former official of the Brotherhood in Turkey. The court accused the defendants of “taking the leadership of a terrorist group, the Brotherhood, and joining that group knowing its purposes.” The referral order stated that between 2015 and 2021 they joined a terrorist group, smuggled funds abroad and possessed inflammatory publications. A red notice obligates all police agencies in all Interpol member states to respond immediately to the request, work to implement what it says and deport the wanted persons to their countries. On Wednesday, an Egyptian court decided to include 20 of the Brotherhood’s leaders on the country’s terrorist lists.
