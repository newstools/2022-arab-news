UMLUJ: The beaches of Umluj governorate in Tabuk region in the northwest of Saudi Arabia are proving a popular destination for residents and visitors this summer, confirming Umluj as one of the Kingdom’s main tourist spots. Duqm beach is one of the most popular in the area, thanks not only to its tourist services, but also to its unique seafront landscape — a mix of sandy hills and coral reefs. Umluj’s other beaches — Al-Hurra, Al-Nasbah, Al-Shabaan and Al-Hassi — are also drawing crowds, especially visitors from outside of the governorate, according to local officials, who credit the long school holidays for the rise in tourist numbers over the summer months.
