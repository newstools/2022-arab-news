Kuwait’s embassy in Britain welcomed on Monday a new travel scheme that will exempt citizens from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries from visa requirements starting 2023, the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported. Under the UK’s new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) scheme, nationals from Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and the UAE will benefit from visa-free travel. 
According to a statement from the Kuwaiti embassy, the move represents “long-standing and enduring” bilateral relations between Britain and Kuwait. 
The ETA is part of the British government’s plan to fully digitalize its border by the end of 2025 and will act similarly to a multi-travel visa covering extended stays. 
Until the scheme comes into effect next year, GCC citizens can continue to apply for the electronic visa waiver online before they travel to Britain.
