RIYADH: Mohammed bin Saeed Al-Jaber, Saudi ambassador to Yemen and supervisor of the Saudi Development and Reconstruction Program for Yemen, met on Tuesday with Dr. Evgeny Kudrov, chargé d’affaires of the Russian Embassy in Yemen. During the meeting, the two affirmed their support for the Yemeni Presidential Leadership Council, headed by Dr. Rashad Al-Alimi. They also discussed the joint efforts being exerted to ensure the success of the UN-sponsored truce with the aim of achieving a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire in Yemen and launching the political process.
