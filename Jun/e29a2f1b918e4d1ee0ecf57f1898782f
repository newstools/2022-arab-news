DOHA: After taking a massive hit from the pandemic, the aviation industry has been seeing a steady recovery after certain flight routes from Gulf countries have surpassed levels from 2019, said Kamil Alawadhi, International Air Transport Association’s regional VP, Africa & The Middle East. During IATA’s Annual General Meeting in Doha, Alawahdi told Arab News that Qatar and the UAE were in the best shape in response to COVID-19 threats against the aviation sector. “They had a committee for Corona, but aviation was a prominent member of that committee. So, the decisions were made with aviation in mind,” he said. Alawadhi added: “When you have other countries where the minister of health decides everything because of Corona, he damages the airport, he damages the airline and he damages the aviation industry.” He went on to say that ministers of health should be cooperating with the aviation industry to ensure the safety of both the sector and passengers. “Saudi Arabia had a different objective, it wasn't complaining about economic issues and travel restrictions and when they opened up, they opened up beautifully, other than the Umrah and Hajj issue, which is a unique issue,” Alawahdi concluded.
