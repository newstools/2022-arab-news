CAIRO: Egypt’s minister of trade and industry has called for reform of the World Trade Organization. “Reform must address the issue of special and differential treatment granted to developing countries” so as to enable them to “achieve their development goals,” Nevin Gamea said on the sidelines of a meeting of African trade ministers. She called for a unified position among African countries that reflects their common interests within the WTO. The meeting adopted an Egyptian proposal to help net food-importing developing countries and least developed countries face food-security challenges.
