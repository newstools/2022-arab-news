GENEVA: The president of the Saudi Red Crescent Authority Jalal Al-Owaisi reiterated the authority's keenness on its international presence on several levels, saying it showed great interest in international organizational work under the umbrella of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Al-Owaisi made his remarks on the sidelines of the 23rd session of the IFRC General Assembly in Geneva, the Saudi Press Agency reported. The IFRC is an international organization that includes societies and bodies of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in more than 192 different countries, making it the largest humanitarian network in the world. It aims to provide support and aid to all those in need, regardless of their gender, race, religion, and political affiliation, in conflicts, famines, disasters, and health emergencies. He said the federation, which was founded in 1919, aimed to inspire, promote, and facilitate humanitarian activities, alleviate human suffering, and implement relief operations to support victims of disasters, such as earthquakes and floods. Nearly 15 million volunteers were cooperating with the federation in achieving these objectives for the good of humanity, he added, noting that the federation’s aid reached around 160 million people worldwide annually through long-term services, development, and disaster response programs. Al-Owaisi said the Saudi Red Crescent Authority was established more than 80 years ago as the National Charitable Air Ambulance Association in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to serve pilgrims. Since that date, it had gone through several stages since its establishment as a charitable association until it transformed into an integrated body that simplified its services to regions across the Kingdom and extended its humanitarian reach beyond the country’s borders.
