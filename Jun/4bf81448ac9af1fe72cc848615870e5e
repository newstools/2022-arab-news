DUBAI: UAE authorities issued a warning reminding the public that the rule on wearing masks indoors, as a precaution against the spread of COVID-19, remains in place and violators would be fined $816 (3,000 dirhams).
Wearing masks in closed areas is still mandatory, according to Dr. Taher Al-Ameri, spokesperson of the National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority, in a report from state news agency WAM.
Coronavirus cases in the country have been increasing sharply, with the number of new infections rising by over 100 percent in just one week, the spokesperson added. 
The rate of hospitalization due to COVID-19 has also been rising, he added. 
Dr. Al-Ameri attributed the increase of infections to some individuals failing to comply with preventative measures, such as mask wearing and isolating after testing positive. 
 “A lack of commitment to isolating was noted among a small group of people infected with COVID-19, which threatens the safety of the community and causes the spread of the virus, due to the lack of commitment of people,” Dr. Al-Ameri said.
The validity period of the green pass system on the Al Hosn app being implemented in Abu Dhabi was also reduced to 14 days from 30 days previously starting Wednesday, June 15. The new rule meanwhile takes effect at a later date, on June 20, for schools in the emirate in consideration of the examination period.
