AMMAN: The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center recently signed an agreement with the King Hussein Cancer Foundation to treat Syrian refugees diagnosed with cancer in Jordan, with a total value of $1.33 million. KSrelief Assistant Supervisor-General for Operations and Programs Ahmed bin Ali Al-Beez and KHCF Director Nisreen Qatamesh signed the agreement at the headquarters of the Saudi Embassy in Amman. The distinguished strategic partnership between KSrelief and KHCF started in 2018 and played a pivotal role in saving the lives of cancer patients, where the provided support contributed to treating several Syrian and Yemeni refugees.
