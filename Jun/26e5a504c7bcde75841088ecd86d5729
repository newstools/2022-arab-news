Family, friends, and food bring people together and I was honored to be joined by new friends to eat, share, and learn.” The star, who is a UNHCR Special Envoy, is known for her work with refugees and has visited numerous camps across the world in recent years, including trips to Yemen, Burkina Faso and Bangladesh.  A post shared by Angelina Jolie (@angelinajolie)  Last week, she took to Instagram to shed light on the plight of children in war. “Children bear the greatest consequences from war. Globally, children account for 30 percent of the population but represent 41 percent of all forcibly displaced people. A collective effort to address the physical and emotional manifestations from trauma must meet not only the needs of children in Ukraine but also Afghanistan, Yemen and so many other often forgotten conflicts that are funded far below levels adequate to meet children’s needs,” she posted. “Local and community-led organizations are innovating new ways to connect children with tools to learn, and nutrition to grow, to help protect them from the worst outcomes of this war, but the global humanitarian response can and must be stronger to ensure this generation of kids have the resources they need to begin healing,” Jolie added.
