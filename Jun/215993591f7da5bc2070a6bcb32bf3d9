ALGIERS: An Algerian court on Thursday sentenced one-time Porto star and ex-national coach Rabah Madjer to six months in jail on Thursday for making “false declarations,” local media reported.
Madjer, who owned two newspapers, was found to have continued to bank cheques from a public advertising agency for a year after the papers were closed.
Charges of forgery and fraud were dropped.
But the 63-year-old and a co-defendant named as Brahim M. were jailed and ordered to pay 500,000 dinars ($3,435) to the national publishing and advertising agency (ANEP).
The Algerian famously scored for Porto against Bayern Munich in the 1987 European Cup final with an audacious back-heel — a move later named after him.
He also scored a crucial goal in a 2-1 victory against West Germany in the 1982 World Cup.
He later went on to coach Algeria’s national football team, but after eight months in the job, he was sacked in June 2018 after a string of defeats.
