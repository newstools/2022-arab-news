Saudi Arabia have reached the final of the 2022 WAFF Futsal Championship after beating Oman 4-3 at Al-Naser Club Hall in Kuwait. Mohsen Fakihi and Abdullah Maghribi scored two goals apiece to set up the final against Kuwait on Monday night. The hosts had defeated Lebanon 6-3 in the other semifinal. Nasser Al-Saadi, head of the futsal and beach football department at the Saudi Arabian Football Federation, told Arabic sports daily Arriyadiyah that the team from the Kingdom fully deserved to reach the final of the tournament, especially after progressing from a tough group that included Kuwait and Iraq. “We have to focus on the final match from now on, and work on achieving our first title in futsal,” he said. The team has talented players who contributed to this achievement, he added.
