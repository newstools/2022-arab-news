Saudi Arabia coach Saad Al-Shehri has attributed his team’s crowning as the new champions of the 2022 AFC U-23 Asian Cup to what he described as “cumulative work,” adding that his focus has now turned to qualification for the 2024 Olympics in Paris. The Young Falcons won their first Asian title in this age category after beating hosts Uzbekistan 2-0 on Sunday night in Tashkent. “A thousand congratulations to all, and a thousand congratulations to our leaders, our people, the players, the administrative and technical bodies and the players for the achievement that has been achieved,” the victorious coach told Arabic sports daily Arriyadiyah. “We have won an important tournament for the first time in Saudi history, and we have become champions of Asia at all levels, and this is important for us,” said Al-Shehri. “The feat is due to cumulative work, and was achieved with the same players that won (the AFC U-19 Championship) in 2018, with a few additions.” He added: “The main target now is qualification to the Paris Olympics." On the final itself, Al-Shehri said: “The match was difficult, and the style of the Uzbekistan team exhausted us in some parts of the match, but we succeeded in scoring the first goal and securing the result with the second. “I have spent a beautiful period with this generation of players, and the focus will be on preparing them for the upcoming tournaments, and I wish everyone success.”
