RIYADH: On June 27, 2002, WWE was forever changed when a then-unknown powerhouse named John Cena stormed onto SmackDown for the first time to take on Kurt Angle. Now, 20 years following his arrival on SmackDown, WWE has designated the month of June to celebrate the anniversary of his debut, culminating in an appearance on RAW on June 27. Since his initial debut, 45-year-old Cena has become a global household name widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time. Over his illustrious career, he has racked up a multitude of achievements, including 16 world title reigns, Hollywood blockbusters, a New York Times best-selling book, a hit album, and a record-setting number of Make-A-Wish grants. Preaching the ethos of Hustle, Loyalty, Respect, Cena has doled out his signature Attitude Adjustments to WWE Hall of Fame stars such as The Rock, Randy Orton, Bautista, Brock Lesnar, and Triple H, as well as some of WWE’s new guard in Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, and Kevin Owens. As part of #CenaMonth, WWE will also be celebrating all things Cena with tribute content across its social media platforms, though his opponent on June 27 has yet to be name.
