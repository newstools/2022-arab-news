RIYADH: The CEO of the Makkah Healthcare Cluster Dr. Hatem bin Ahmed Al-Omari inaugurated the center for elderly and geriatric diseases at King Abdulaziz Hospital, a member of the Makkah Healthcare Cluster, on Sunday. The center is the first at the level of Ministry of Health hospitals in providing treatment and preventive advice for the elderly. It will evaluate cases of those aged 65 and above to diagnose conditions including cognitive impairment, memory impairment, functional deterioration and excessive medication. In addition to providing appropriate treatment for medical conditions, the center also provides home care services for appropriate cases that meet certain conditions. The center is part of the modern healthcare model supervised by the executive medical administration of the healthcare cluster in Makkah, which aims to promote healthy living through prevention and treatment of diseases as well as disabilities in elderly people. Al-Omari was also briefed on the services launched by the operations executive department represented by the guest services department. Several services have been combined so that a single site provides printing and reporting, medical coordination and treatment eligibility information, management, a family and admissions office, outpatient appointment bookings, medical file access, outpatient referrals as well as medical committee appointment bookings. At the opening ceremony, which was attended by senior officials from the Ministry of Health and the hospital, Al-Omari praised the development of the center. The opening of the new facility emphasizes the Kingdom’s efforts to improve the quality of life of the elderly and the services provided to them. In 1990, the UN General Assembly voted to establish the the International Day for Older Persons, which is celebrated around the world on Oct. 1 each year.
