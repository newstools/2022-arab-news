RIYADH: Saudi fashion designer Sufana Al-Turkistani and Italian Egyptian marketeer Shahinaz Rashid have created a brand called TheSufana, which specializes in making modern corsets, garments with a hard body that contours the torso. “We started making specialized corsets to expand our collection and show a different side of fashion. Through our collections, we want to create designs for all body types and hijabis,” said Al-Turkistani. Her collection comprises handmade and luxurious modern corsets with pockets or an asymmetrical style for a young and fresh take on the garment. Al-Turkistani was always fascinated by corsets but wanted to make them as comfortable and modern as possible, knowing how difficult it can be to find perfectly fitting corsets. “I studied fashion in Cairo, Egypt, at the Italian Fashion Academy. After some brainstorming, I shared the idea with my current partner in crime, Shahinaz and asked her to join me on the adventure. She handles all the directing and marketing of the brand,” she said. TheSufana is about transmitting confidence to consumers through its pieces and empowering girls to be bold, or “osé,” to use a word Al-Turkistani favors. “‘Osé’ is a French word that means “brave” or “daring,” she said. “What we mean by being ‘osé’ is being bold and confident when wearing our corsets or being a head-turner.” Al-Turkistani is looking forward to participating in the next Riyadh Season and hopes to have her own showrooms in Saudi Arabia and Italy.
