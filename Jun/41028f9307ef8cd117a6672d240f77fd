MADINAH: Saudi Arabia has launched a Digital Experience Maturity Index for 12 government services to improve people’s experiences and increase their satisfaction. It relies on three basic perspectives to measure the maturity of government platforms to achieve user satisfaction, improve the user experience, and enhance the mechanism for handling complaints and reports, the Saudi Press Agency reported. The platforms to be measured in the first cycle are Etimad, Absher, Madrasati, Najiz, Sakani, Qiwa, Tawakkalna, Sehhaty, Saber, Balady, Fasah, and Ehsan. Ahmed bin Mohammad Al-Suwaiyan, who is the governor of the Digital Government Authority, said these 12 would be the focus of the first cycle as they were among the highest-priority platforms based on specific criteria. He launched the index during his speech at the 8th National Conference for Quality, which concluded on Wednesday in Madinah. The event was organized by the Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization under the theme of “Sustainable Quality for an Ambitious Nation.” Al-Suwaiyan stressed the importance of the digital government’s contribution to achieving national goals by improving people’s quality of life, whether they were citizens, residents, or visitors, facilitating doing business, enhancing competitiveness, increasing government work efficiency, and enhancing the country’s digital ranking in global indexes. The authority regulates the digital government's platforms, websites, digital services, and government networks. It also issues measurements, indicators, tools, and reports to measure the performance and capabilities of government agencies in the field of digital government.
