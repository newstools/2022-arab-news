RIYADH: Saudi Arabia on Wednesday welcomed the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors’ resolution stressing that Iran must comply with its obligations under the safeguards agreement, and the necessity to cooperate with the agency to resolve all outstanding nuclear issues, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. Saudi Arabia called on Iran to cooperate with the IAEA and resolve outstanding issues without delay, hoping that the board of governors member states will fully support the agency and its director general, the statement added. The IAEA said Wednesday it had adopted a resolution formally criticizing Iran for a lack of cooperation with the UN nuclear inspectorate, diplomatic sources told AFP. The motion brought by the United States, Britain, France and Germany — but voted against by Russia and China — is the first to criticize Iran since June 2020 and comes amid an impasse on efforts to bring the US back into a 2015 deal over Iran’s nuclear program.
