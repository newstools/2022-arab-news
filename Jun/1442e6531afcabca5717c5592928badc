RIYADH: The National Transformation Program, one of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 initiatives, recently signed an agreement with the Saudi Grains Organization and the Savola World Foundation to minimize food waste in the Kingdom. The “Negaderha” project by Savola plans to initiate campaigns targeting households in the Kingdom as part of the deal. The project has already distributed more than 1 million food containers to 143,000 households to combat food waste. The NTP and SAGO plan to empower nonprofit organizations and ensure food security through making businesses more sustainable, encouraging volunteering, and limiting food waste. The Savola World Foundation was established in 2019 under the supervision of the Ministry of Human Resource and Social Development. It is a nonprofit organization focused on social development and preserving the environment. The NTP was founded in 2016, and seeks to establish the infrastructure and conditions that will allow the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to implement the Kingdom’s Vision 2030. This will be done by reforming government operations, supporting digital transformation, promoting private sector development, forming economic partnerships, advancing social development, and ensuring the sustainability of key resources.
