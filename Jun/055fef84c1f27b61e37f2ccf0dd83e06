Saudi Arabia reached the semifinals of the 2022 WAFF Women’s Futsal Championship after beating Oman 5-0 at King Abdullah Sports City Hall in Jeddah on Monday night. The result ensured the Green Falcons ended second in Group E with three points, having lost their first match 3-1 to Kuwait, who finished top with a maximum of six points. Oman were last in the group having lost both their matches. Saudi’s goals came from a brace each by Raghad Mukhayzin and Lana Abdelrazek, and a strike from Leen Mohammed, to set a date with Group A winners Bahrain in the semifinals of the tournament on Wednesday. The other last-four clash will see Kuwait take on Iraq on the same day. Meanwhile Palestine and Oman will meet earlier on Wednesday in the fifth-place playoff. The tournament, organized by the West Asia Football Federation, concludes on Friday, June 24, with the final and the third-place playoffs.
