MAKKAH: The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has announced that registration is now open for local pilgrims, citizens and residents wishing to perform Hajj this year. Applicants must be no older than 65 and must have a valid residency permit. Registration opened on Friday, and the ministry said that priority will be given to those who have not previously performed Hajj and are fully immunized as per their status on the Tawakkalna application. The ministry said that registration can be completed through the Eatmarna application, which allows pilgrims to review all available packages, or online at https://localhaj.haj.gov.sa. Online, pilgrims can create a list of preferred packages, choose from them, add companions and ensure that all their data, such as immunization status, is correct and that requirements are met. The ministry called on all applicants to ensure the accuracy of the information they provide when registering their data and choosing packages, noting that if several individuals are registered in one application, the system deals with the group as a single application. If one of the parties does not meet the terms, the application will be canceled. The ministry noted that all applications will be processed after the registration deadline expires, adding that all inquiries and suggestions can be sent via e-mail to care@haj.gov.sa, the number 920002814, or the Twitter account @MOHU around the clock. Chairman of the Coordination Council Dr. Saed Al-Juhani told Arab News that 177 domestic companies catering to pilgrims are operating this year, providing a variety of services, including tents and electricity.
