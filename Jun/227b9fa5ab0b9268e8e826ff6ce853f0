TASHKENT: Saudi Arabia's U-23 team beat hosts Uzbekistan in the final of the AFC U-23 Asian Cup to win their first title in the competition. The young Green Falcons scored two second half goals to win the match, with Ahmed Al-Ghamdi's 48th minute goal and a Firas Albrikan strike 12 minutes from time sealing the title. The Saudis had to withstand some early pressure from the Uzbek side, but took control of the game in the second spell. The victory gives Saudi Arabia its first win in the competition, having finished runners-up in 2013 and 2020. The 2022 title was won by Saudi Arabia without conceding a single goal in six matches.
