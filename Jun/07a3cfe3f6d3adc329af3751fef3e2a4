DUBAI: Canadian superstar Justin Bieber is still scheduled to do his overseas tour shows, including his two Dubai concerts, despite being diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle Last week, the multi-Grammy winner revealed on social media that the rare disorder paralyzed half his face and affected nerves through a shingles outbreak. The singer’s tour promoter this week announced on Twitter that his health condition has forced him to cancel only his remaining tour concerts in the US. The “Yummy” hitmaker is expected to perform at Dubai’s Coca-Cola Arena on Oct. 8 and Oct. 9. Dubai is just one stop on his tour of more than 30 countries — including London, Tokyo, Jakarta, Sao Paulo and Paris — which will run until March 2023. Summerfest’s social media account assured fans that “Justin continues to receive the best medical care possible.”
