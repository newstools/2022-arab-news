VIENNA: The International Atomic Energy Agency said Wednesday it had adopted a resolution formally criticizing Iran for a lack of cooperation with the UN nuclear inspectorate, diplomatic sources told AFP.
The motion brought by the United States, Britain, France and Germany — but voted against by Russia and China — is the first to criticize Iran since June 2020 and comes amid an impasse on efforts to bring the US back into a 2015 deal over Iran’s nuclear program. Israel hailed the resolution chiding Iran. 
“This is a significant resolution that exposes Iran’s true face,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement, adding that IAEA members had “worked together with the aim of arresting and preventing Iran’s attainment of nuclear weaponry.”
“If Iran continues with its activities, major countries should bring the Iranian issue back to the Security Council,” he added.
Earlier, the US said it would be regrettable and counterproductive for Iran to remove two of the UN nuclear watchdog’s surveillance cameras as it has announced.
“If accurate, reports that Iran plans to reduce transparency in response to this resolution are extremely regrettable and counterproductive to the diplomatic outcome we seek,” a US statement to a meeting of the 35-nation Board of Governors said ahead of the vote on the US-backed draft resolution. “We do not seek escalation (with Iran).”
