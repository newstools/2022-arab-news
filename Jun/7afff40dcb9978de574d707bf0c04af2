RIYADH: The Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority (ZATCA) has held an awareness workshop for Japanese companies working in Saudi Arabia that are subject to tax regulations. The workshop, which was held at the authority’s headquarters in Riyadh, addressed the role of the designated manager in supporting taxpayers by following up and processing their cases. It also covered the manager’s role in promoting awareness of the procedures and initiatives provided by the authority. The workshop was attended by the Japanese Ambassador to the Kingdom Iwai Fumio and the vice governor of operations at the authority, Abdullah Al-Sadhan. ZATCA has conducted more than 250 workshops since the beginning of 2021, targeting all categories related to its business from various commercial sectors. The authority’s workshops are designed to educate taxpayers in the business who are subject to tax regulations and to facilitate cross-border trade. During this workshop, ZATCA reviewed the transaction pricing system in the Kingdom and the mechanism for submitting documents. It also discussed the procedures for examination, objections and settlements from the date of initiating the case until its closure, as well as the collection procedures and the submission of explanatory decisions. The awareness workshop also highlighted the authority’s initiatives for facilitating cross-border trade, which are based on the importance of ensuring the speed and flexibility of customs procedures for clearing imports and all associated logistics services. The workshop also touched on the definition of electronic invoicing and its basic requirements.
