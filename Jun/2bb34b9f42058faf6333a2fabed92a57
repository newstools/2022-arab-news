BAGHDAD: At least two people were killed and seven injured in Turkish airstrikes targeting the Sinjar Resistance Units or YBS, a militia affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK, in Iraq’s northern province of Sinjar, security sources said on Wednesday. They said one strike targeted an intelligence headquarters and another hit a civilian area, causing damage to nearby shops. Videos on social media showed plumes of thick smoke and fires ablaze while people ran away in the street, though Reuters could not immediately verify the videos. The strike hit a “municipal council building in Snuny,” a village near the border with Syria, said a security official in autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan. “A 12-year-old child was killed and six other people were wounded,” the official said on condition of anonymity. There has been a long-running Turkish campaign in Iraq and Syria against militants of the PKK and the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which are both regarded as terrorist groups by Ankara. Turkey regularly carries out airstrikes into northern Iraq and has sent commandos to support its offensives. In April, the Turkish Foreign Ministry summoned the Iraqi charge d’affaires after Baghdad accused Ankara of violating its sovereignty and called on it to withdraw all of its forces from Iraqi territory. The PKK took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.
