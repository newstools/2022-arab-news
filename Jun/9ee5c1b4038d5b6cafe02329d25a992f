LONDON: Lebanon joined the UAE, Saudi Arabia and 11 other countries across the world on Tuesday to prohibit the new Pixar animated film “Lightyear” from screening in cinemas.
The animated film, scheduled for worldwide release on Thursday, features a scene involving a same-sex kiss between two of its characters.
While Lebanon did not immediately offer any official justification for the decision, the UAE’s Media Regulatory Office said on Monday that the film “violates the country’s media content standards.”
Indonesia, Egypt, and Malaysia are among the countries to prevent the “Toy Story” spin-off from commercial screening.
Lebanon does not have a consistent policy toward film and media censorship. Films such as “Bohemian Rhapsody” which depicted the life of Freddie Mercury, were allowed to screen across the country.
Meanwhile, Marvel’s “Eternals” was heavily edited, to cut out scenes of same-sex relationships.
Notably, “Eternals” was also banned from screening across cinemas in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar.
Films such as “West Side Story” and “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” were also banned in various countries across the region, including the UAE, for including trans and homosexual characters.
The UAE later removed the ban on “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” opting instead for a 21+ rating.
