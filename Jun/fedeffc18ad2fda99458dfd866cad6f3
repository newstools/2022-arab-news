RIYADH: The Saudi government gave a green light to the Bank of Jordan to open branches in the Kingdom to practice banking activities, Saudi Press Agency reported. King Salman chaired the Cabinet’s session at Al-Salam Palace in Jeddah on Tuesday. Listed on the Amman Stock Exchange, the Bank of Jordan was founded in 1960 and it operates over 100 branches in the country. King Salman updated the Cabinet on messages he sent to Oman’s ruler Sultan Haitham bin Tariq, Qatar’s Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and Kuwait’s Emir Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah — along with the message he received from President of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov. Subsequently, the Cabinet went through the meetings and talks in recent days between the Kingdom’s senior officials and their counterparts in a number of friendly countries, aiming at expanding bilateral and multilateral cooperation in a range of areas. The Cabinet lauded the success of the 13th session of the Joint Moroccan-Saudi Commission which ministers agreed had served to further strengthen relations between the two countries. In a statement to the Saudi Press Agency, Minister of State and Acting Minister of Media Dr. Ibrahim Al-Assaf reiterated the Kingdom’s support for Sudan and its people, a statement recently expressed to the Human Rights Council. Saudi Arabia also called on the international community to work toward laying the foundations for security and peace in the North African country. In addition, Cabinet members pointed out that the Kingdom’s singling out of individuals and entities for their links to the Iran-backed Houthis showed a continued determination to target those who fueled violence in Yemen that threatened to destabilize the region and international shipping.
