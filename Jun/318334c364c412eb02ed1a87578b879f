RIYADH: Saudi Arabia kicked off their AFC U23 Asian Cup 2022 campaign in Uzbekistan with a comfortable 5-0 win over Tajikistan at the Lokomotiv Club Stadium in Tashkent. The Saudi team now lead Group D on goal difference from Japan, who earlier on Friday defeated the UAE 2-1. The Young Falcons took the lead through Hamad Al-Yami in the 42nd minute, before the floodgates opened in the second half. Ayman Yahya scored the second goal four minutes after the break, and Haitham Asiri made it 3-0 in the 68th minute. Miteb Al-Harbi scored the fourth goal with four minutes of the 90 left and, in stoppage time, Abdullah Radif added the fifth goal from a penalty spot. Saudi Arabia play Japan on Monday, with Tajikistan meeting the UAE on the same day.
