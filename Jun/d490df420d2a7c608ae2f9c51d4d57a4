DIRIYAH: The Diriyah Biennale Foundation has announced that the inaugural edition of the Islamic Arts Biennale will take place at the iconic Hajj Terminal at the King Abdulaziz International Airport, Jeddah, from Jan. 23-April 23, 2023. A distinguished international multidisciplinary team will curate the biennale under the theme of Awwal Bayt (First House). The event will be held at the terminal which was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 1981, and was the recipient of the 1983 Aga Khan Award for Architecture. There will also be a purpose-built 70,000 square meter venue with facilities to include exhibition spaces, a theatre, a mosque, workshops, classrooms dedicated to programming, as well as retail and dining. This new venue, made possible through the cooperation between the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Transport, and the General Authority of Civil Aviation, will further enrich the Hajj Terminal’s functional and spiritual relevance. In addition to welcoming millions of pilgrims annually, it will also become a hub for celebrating Islamic arts and culture and fostering Jeddah’s local art ecosystem throughout the year. The terminal is the destination for pilgrims from around the world embarking on the annual Hajj pilgrimage, making it the unifying focus for all Muslims. The concept of Awwal Bayt examines how the Holly Kaaba and the Prophet’s Mosque in Madinah inspire Muslims worldwide on cultural and spiritiual levels to create a sense of belonging in their own home.
