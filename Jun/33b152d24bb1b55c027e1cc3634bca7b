During the campaign in the city of Maradi, the voluntary team conducted 6,236 medical examinations and performed 407 surgeries. It also dispensed 5,272 medicines and distributed 1,000 pairs of glasses. The objective of the campaign was to provide medical treatment to people with eye diseases living in poor countries in accordance with the agreement signed between KSrelief and Al-Basar International Foundation. Meanwhile, the prosthetic limb and rehabilitation center in the governorate of Hadhramaut in Yemen is continuing to provide medical services with the support of KSrelief. The center provided 1,435 services for 340 people in one month, including the manufacturing, fitting, delivery and maintenance of prosthetic limbs for 121 patients and physical therapy and consultation sessions, among other treatments, for the remaining 219 patients. KSrelief is also supporting a nutrition project for children under the age of 5, pregnant women and nursing mothers in the Yemeni governorates of Aden, Lahij, Taiz, Hodeidah, Hadramout, Hajjah and Marib. The project, which aims to provide nutritional therapy, healthcare and counseling services, has helped 59,193 people in one week. The above services are part of Saudi Arabia’s efforts, through KSrelief, to alleviate the suffering of Yemenis, especially mothers and children struggling with malnutrition amid the current humanitarian crisis.
