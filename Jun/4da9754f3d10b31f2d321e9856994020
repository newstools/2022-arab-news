JEDDAH: A Saudi man is facing 10 years in jail and a SR30 million fine ($8 million) for illegally keeping three lions at his private resort in Riyadh. A team from the National Center for Wildlife, in cooperation with the Special Forces for Environmental Security, began investigating a report that three lions were being kept in a rest house in the Saudi capital, an act considered a violation of the country's environmental system. The team was able to control the big cats, anesthetize them, and transfer them to one of the center's animal care units. The Saudi Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture has begun implementing strict executive regulations to control hunting in the Kingdom to preserve the country’s wildlife. It has said that illegal hunters will face heavy penalties for any unauthorized practice. The ministry has specified penalties for unauthorized practices, including imprisonment of up to 10 years or a fine of no more than SR30 million for certain violations if committed twice or more within one year.
