JEDDAH: Saudi Arabian Airlines has won Canadian publication Pax’s award for best children’s amenities.
Saudia won the trade magazine’s accolade for a children’s entertainment “goody bag” offered on its international flights.
The award is the latest the national flag carrier has received in recent years for products and services it offers to a diverse range of passengers.
The children’s kit is lightweight, designed to be child friendly, and made of safe, eco-friendly materials. It contains various items that young travelers enjoy and features a colorful cast of Saudia-themed cartoon characters.
Coloring books, crayons, sleeping masks and volume-controlled earbuds are included in the amenity kit.
Saudia also provides kids’ meals, child-specific in-flight entertainment, and play areas within the Alfursan lounges.
Meanwhile, Saudia is ensuring smooth travel arrangements for visiting pilgrims to limit overcrowding and long waits in the airport during baggage and check-in procedures.
The airline is offering a new luggage service for its Hajj customers traveling on international flights, collecting luggage from their hotel or other accommodation in Makkah and Madinah 24 hours before their departure, and delivering it to the correct airport baggage center before they arrive.
