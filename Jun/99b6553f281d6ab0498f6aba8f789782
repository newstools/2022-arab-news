Saudi Arabia have reached the semi-finals of the 2022 AFC U-23 Asian Cup after overcoming Vietnam 2-0 in their last-eight clash on Sunday night at the Lokomotiv Stadium in Tashkent. It is the second time in a row, and third overall, that Saudi Arabia have reached the semi-finals of the tournament, though they have yet to win the competition. Their goals came from Moteb Al-Harbi and Firas Al-Buraikan in the 41st and 65th minutes respectively. Saad Al-Shehri’s team will now meet Australia on Wednesday at the same venue. In the day’s other quarter-final, Japan defeated South Korea 3-0, while Saturday’s action had seen Australia beat Turkmenistan 1-0 and Uzbekistan overcome Iraq 3-2 on penalties after extra time had ended in a 2-2 draw. The hosts will take on Japan in the other semi-final on Wednesday.
