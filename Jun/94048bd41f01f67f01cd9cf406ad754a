The Egyptian Football Association has announced the dismissal of national team coach Ehab Galal, after a run of unconvincing performances during the qualifiers for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations. Galal had taken over from Portuguese coach Carlos Queiroz in April after Egypt failed to qualify in March for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. They had fallen to Senegal, the team that had also conquered them in a dramatic penalty shootout in February’s Africa Cup of Nations final. Egypt kicked off their qualifying campaign for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations with an unconvincing 1-0 win over Guinea on June 5, but followed up with a 2-0 loss to Ethiopia four days later. A 4-1 defeat to South Korea in friendly on Tuesday prompted the association to dismiss Galal. Hazem Imam, a member of the association’s board of directors, said at a press conference yesterday that plans are already underway to appoint a foreign coach this summer. He also revealed that he would seek foreign technical directors, one for the Olympic team, and the other to oversee the federation. “I was delegated with Mohamed Barakat, a member of the association, to finalize the negotiations with the foreign coaches, and to appoint a foreign development manager for the referees’ committee,” said Imam.
