RIYADH: Saudi Arabia has renewed its call to ensure the safety and security of the Rohingya Muslims and to recognize their basic rights. The Kingdom’s envoy to the UN in Geneva Dr. Abdulaziz Al-Wasel said the right to full citizenship, and to provide suitable conditions to voluntary, safe and dignified return for Rohingya refugees should be recognized. He called for the renunciation of violence and the resolution of the crisis through dialogue. An urgent and lasting solution that guarantees the safety and security of the Rohingya Muslims and other minorities was needed, Al-Wasel told the Human Rights Council. The diplomat said that marginalization, systemic discrimination, poverty and long-standing persecution of the Rohingya in Myanmar’s Rakhine State have led to massive and widespread abuses, including their mass forced displacement, enforced disappearances, detention, violence, human trafficking and torture. Al-Wasel stressed the need to address the root causes of the crisis in Rakhine State in order to achieve lasting peace, build a society based on the principles of equality and non-discrimination, and strengthen interfaith dialogue and address hate speech.
