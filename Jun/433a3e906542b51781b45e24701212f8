RIYADH: Gamers8, the world’s biggest esports and gaming event, is taking place for eight weeks this summer in Riyadh. It is being held at a state-of-the-art, purpose-built venue at Riyadh Boulevard City from July 14 to Sept. 8, with some of the world’s top players taking part. Hosted under the theme of “Gamers8 – Your Portal to the Next World," the action will unfold alongside festivals, concerts, shows, and other events. The competition will be contested across six different titles – with a $15 million prize pool up for grabs. Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan, chairman of the Saudi Esports Federation, said: “With an estimated 23.5 million gamers across the country, almost every home in the Kingdom has someone with a deep passion for gaming. This passion for gaming has long been a source of pride for Saudis. “The gaming sector in Saudi Arabia has been on a journey of progress and development that matches the greater ambitions of the country drawn by Vision 2030 – and that is epitomized by the hosting of Gamers8. The event in Riyadh this summer has a mission to blur the lines between what's physical and what's virtual and offer a spectacle and an occasion beyond what anyone has experienced before. “Our goal is to bring the virtual world of esports and gaming out into the physical realm of Riyadh – a global city with immense purpose and burgeoning opportunity, and the ideal setting for Gamers8. We look forward to seeing you all this summer for what will be an unforgettable, futuristic, and incredible time.” Organized by the Saudi Esports Federation, Gamers8 will focus on four main pillars: Professional esports, festivals, music, and The Next World Summit, an esports and gaming conference that will bring together sector leaders and experts from around the world. Eight international artists will perform across the eight weeks alongside local and regional talent. Concerts begin on July 14 and run until Sept 1.
