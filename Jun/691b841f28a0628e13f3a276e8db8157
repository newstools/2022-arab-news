RIYADH: Senegal always stands with Saudi Arabia against Houthi aggression, said the African nation’s foreign minister, the Saudi Press Agency reported early Wednesday. Aïssata Tall Sall, who received her Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, in Dakar, said the two nations’ coordination in a number of fields was elevating, especially in combating terrorism. The Iran-backed Yemeni militia has over the past few years attacked civilian targets inside the Kingdom, and has been condemned by the international community. A truce at the start of April has continually been violated by the Houthis in parts of Yemen. The diplomats signed a memorandum on political consultations during the meeting. Prince Faisal said that he looks forward to holding the joint Saudi-Senegalese committee and sign a direct investment agreement between the two countries, which will contribute to strengthening bilateral relations. The arrival of Saudi Arabia’s top diplomat in the west African nation comes after the visit of President Macky Sall to the Kingdom in April, where he held a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Prince Faisal also congratulated Senegal on assuming the presidency of the African Union, and expressed the Kingdom’s wishes of success. The Senegalese foreign minister restated her country’s support for Saudi Arabia’s bid to host Expo 2030 in Riyadh.
