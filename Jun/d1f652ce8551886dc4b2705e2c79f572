CAIRO: Egypt and Qatar are holding talks to expand investments in new areas and increase their volume, especially in the energy sector, said Egyptian Minister of Trade and Industry Nevin Gamea. During her participation in the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha, Gamea said: “During my current visit to Doha, I presented investment opportunities to the Qatari side in the field of manufacturing industries, specialized industries, textiles and leather industries as a kind of partnership between the two sides.” She added: “There is communication between the two sides to create the climate for opening the capital of Egyptian companies to the Qatari business sector.” Gamea said that current Qatari investments are focused on real estate, hotels and tourism, noting that there is a common desire to enhance these investments to reflect the good relations between Qatar and Egypt. The minister met with officials in the Free Zones Authority, the Qatar Investment Authority and the Qatari Businessmen Association. Gamea also revealed plans to launch a joint business council between the two countries, which will consist of businessmen strengthening relations in economy, investment and trade. The Egyptian minister said that she had floated a proposal for an Egyptian exhibition in Doha to sell products in Qatar with the Qatari Minister of Commerce and Industry Mohammed bin Hamad bin Qassim Al Thani and the Qatari Businessmen Association. Gamea said: “This will contribute to increasing the volume of trade exchange between the two countries, which is modest and does not rise to the size of the relations between the two countries. Therefore, there is interest on both sides to increase trade exchange by searching for new opportunities and prospects for cooperation in this aspect.”
