DUBAI: The UAE dispatched a plane carrying 30 tonnes of food aid to support survivors of a devastating earthquake that killed 1,500 people and wounded scores more, Emirates news agency (WAM) reported on Friday. The aid comes after the UAE started operating an air bridge to help those impacted by the earthquake, said WAM. The relief is part of “the UAE’s efforts to support vulnerable and crisis-hit communities across different countries,” read the WAM statement. Humanitarian assistance has been pouring in for the earthquake survivors as Afghanistan authorities seek emergency medical supplies to treat the injured.
