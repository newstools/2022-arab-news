TOKYO: Japan Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Tuesday declined to confirm an Israeli missile attack on Damascus International Airport but said Japan was keeping an eye on the situation. Damascus International Airport suffered major damage – including to runways – following a missile attack believed to be by Israel. “I am aware of the announcement made by the Syrian authorities,” Hayashi replied in answer to a question by Arab News Japan. “On the other hand, I am also aware that Israel has not made any comment as to whether or not they carried out any attacks.” “But in any case, Japan will continue to place a close eye on what’s happening in the Middle East, including the impact of this incident. Japan will continue to cooperate closely with the relevant countries to make diplomatic efforts to ease regional tensions and work towards stability in the area,” he said. In response to a query about the forced takeover of Palestinian land, Hayashi replied: “From an international standpoint, we understand that the act of annexing territory using force is not allowed.” Originally published in Arab News Japan.
