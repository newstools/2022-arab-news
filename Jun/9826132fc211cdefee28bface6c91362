JEDDAH: Jeddah-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation expressed profound concern over the continuation of the sufferings of Rohingya Muslims residing in Rakhin state, complaining from racial segregation and violence, forcing them to migrate to neighboring Bangladesh and other countries.
This came at a joint statement of the member countries delivered by the Saudi Charge d'Affaires in New York Councilor Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Atiq during a non-official referral presented by the UN special envoy to Myanmar Nolin Herz. Al-Atiq said that the member states of OIC are closely following what is going in and are deeply concerned of the current disturbing situation.
