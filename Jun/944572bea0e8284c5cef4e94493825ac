DUBAI: Oman’s Sultan Haitham bin Tariq has ordered a cabinet reshuffle, various media reports say. The Omani ruler issued a royal decree appointing Salim Al-Awfi as minister of energy and minerals, replacing long-time minister Mohammed bin Hamad Al-Rumhi; Dr. Mohammed Al-Maamari as minister of endowments and religious affairs and Dr. Hilal Al-Sabti as minister of health.
