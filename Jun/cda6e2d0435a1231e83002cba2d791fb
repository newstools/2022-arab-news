AL-MUKALLA, Yemen: The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center on Sunday inaugurated the 12th Voluntary Medical Project for Open Heart Surgery for Adults in Al-Mukalla as part of Nabdh Al-Saudia Volunteer Program for Cardiac Catheterization and Surgery in the city.
The program is being held between May 29 and June 3.
The voluntary medical team, affiliated with the center, has so far conducted eight open heart surgeries, all of which were successful.
Separately, the general supervisor of center said that Saudi Arabia has a long history of charity and supporting impoverished people abroad.
Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah delivered a lecture at the headquarters of the Islamic University in Madinah.
He told the audience that the volume of Saudi aid between 1996 and 2021 amounted to $94.6 billion delivered to 165 countries around the world.
Al-Rabeeah recalled the humanitarian history of Saudi Arabia. He said that the Kingdom provided international humanitarian aid in 1950 to the victims of the Punjab floods, despite the limited income of the Kingdom at the time.
In 1974, the Kingdom established the Saudi Fund for Development with the aim of stimulating economic growth in developing countries, benefiting 55 countries within four years.
In 1999, the Kingdom made official donations to the victims of the Kosovo War, and in 2004 donated to victims of the Boxing Day tsunami.
