LONDON: Arabic music-streaming platform Anghami released an upgraded version of its app for Apple Watch on Thursday. The update means that users can now play and control their music directly from their Watch without having to use their phones. The new features include the ability to access the user’s library, as well as lists of recently played tracks and albums. The upgraded app is available now on the Apple Store and the update will be downloaded automatically. Anghami said its service is now accessible on all devices, from Smart TVs and tablets to mobile phones. Users can choose from more than 70 million Arabic and international songs and thousands of podcasts. As part of its efforts to strengthen its position as the leading music and entertainment streaming platform in the Arab world, Anghami has previously partnered with other platforms for special promotions and to boost its library of content. In April, for example, it signed a strategic partnership with new digital platform TOD to stream a curated selection of TOD’s exclusive beIN Sports content and entertainment programming. The same month, Anghami signed a strategic partnership with Rotana Music Holding, a major Arab independent record label, to distribute Rotana’s collection of original audio and video content on the platform.
