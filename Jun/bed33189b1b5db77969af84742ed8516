CAIRO: The Supreme Committee for the Management of the Epidemiology and Health Pandemic Crisis in Egypt has announced the abolition of all restrictions imposed on the entry of Egyptians or foreigners. This followed a review of the epidemiological situation inside and outside the country, during a meeting of the committee headed by Dr. Mostafa Madbouly, prime minister of Egypt, at the government headquarters in the new administrative capital. The official spokesman for the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, Ambassador Nader Saad, said: “During the meeting, a decision was approved stipulating that all restrictions imposed on the entry of Egyptians or foreigners into the Arab Republic of Egypt should be canceled.” Dr. Khaled Abdel Ghafar, minister of higher education and scientific research, reviewed the latest epidemiological developments for the coronavirus locally and globally. He also reviewed the current statistics on vaccination, explaining that about 86.6 million doses were provided to citizens, with 4.5 million booster doses following. He added that there are currently 57.5 million doses available. Spokesman for the Egyptian Ministry of Health, Hossam Abdel Ghaffar, said that the decision to cancel restrictions on the entry of Egyptians and foreigners was based on a study of the epidemiological situation around the world. “The situation in Egypt is in a state of severe improvement, and the rates of infection and hospitalization are decreasing,” Abdel Ghaffar said. He said that the Supreme Committee took the decision to lift the measures based on the above, explaining that “38 countries worldwide have taken the same measures since May.” “Today, after two years of dealing with the coronavirus, vaccines have been made available, the virus and its mutations have been understood, and the health world is looking at a different strategy toward the epidemic,” he said.
