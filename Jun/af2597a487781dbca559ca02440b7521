JEDDAH: Four Arab states, the US and Israel agreed on Monday to forge closer ties and hold annual foreign ministers’ meetings amid a flurry of diplomatic activity before US President Joe Biden’s first visit to the Middle East.
The UAE, Egypt, Morocco and Bahrain took part in Monday’s six-country talks in Manama, following a summit in the Negev desert in March. The aim is to drive closer cooperation in areas including security, clean energy, and food and water security.
A joint statement also expressed the group’s support for a negotiated settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Foreign ministers from the six countries are expected to meet annually and there will be further talks this year.

The new moves came after King Abdullah of Jordan backed the idea of a NATO-style defense alliance for the Middle East, and before Biden visits Israel, the occupied West Bank and Saudi Arabia from July 13 to 16.
Among a series of official visits in the past week, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman went to Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, Iraq’s prime minister was in Saudi Arabia and Iran, and Qatar’s emir visited Cairo for the first time in seven years.
