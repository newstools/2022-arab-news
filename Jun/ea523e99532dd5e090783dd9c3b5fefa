DUBAI: Google is celebrating the life of medical pioneer Dr. Saniya Habboub, one of Lebanon’s first female doctors who went on to inspire countless other Lebanese girls and women to seek an education. June 10 marks the day Habboub graduated from medical school in the United States in 1931. The doctor received her medical degree in gynecology and obstetrics from the Women’s Medical College in Pennsylvania. In tribute to her success, the university invited a Lebanese historian and professor from Princeton University to give the commencement speech on her graduation day. Habboub showed her gratitude to the school by providing future students with a scholarship in her name. On returning to Beirut in 1933, she started a practice in her neighborhood called Bab Idriss. Habboub also co-founded the Lebanese Red Crescent Association and served as a board member for the Muslim Orphan’s Home, the Young Women’s Muslim Association and Maqassed Hospital. After 50 years of devoted medical service, the Lebanese government honored her with a Health Medal of Merit in 1982 and named a street in Beirut after her.
