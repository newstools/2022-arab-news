JEDDAH: The sky’s the limit for visitors to the Jeddah Season of activities where tethered balloon trips are offering them a bird’s-eye view of the city. Up to 29 passengers can take to the air with an Aerophile-certified pilot for rides lasting around 10 minutes in the 150-meter-high balloon located in City Walk, one of the festival zones. The helium balloon, which is 22.46 meters in diameter, is anchored to the ground by ropes. Flights are dependent on weather conditions.
