LONDON: US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf is expected to travel to Israel and the West Bank on Saturday, the State Department announced on Friday.
During her four-day visit, Leaf will “consult with Israeli and Palestinian partners on a range of priorities, including deepening bilateral US cooperation with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority.”
The State Department said that she will also discuss Israeli-Palestinian relations and US support for a two-state solution, as well as deterring Iran’s aggressive regional activities, and support for Israel’s integration into the broader Middle East region.
During the visit, Leaf will meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and representatives of civil societies from both sides. 
She will be accompanied by Deputy Assistant Secretary for Israeli and Palestinian Affairs Hady Amr and NSC Director for Israel and Palestinian Affairs Cynthia Cook, the State Department added.
The announcement comes a day after the US upgraded its diplomatic mission to the Palestinians, reversing a Trump administration move ahead of a planned visit by President Joe Biden in July.
On Thursday, Palestinian officials hosted Amr in Ramallah, their seat of government in the occupied West Bank. They had no immediate comment at the end of the meeting.(With Reuters)
