RIYADH: Park Joon-yong, South Korea’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia, met with the Shoura Council’s Saudi-Korean Parliamentary Friendship Committee, headed by its Chairman Maj. Gen. Ali bin Mohammad Al-Asiri, to discuss ways to further enhance bilateral relations. “During the meeting, Al-Asiri highlighted the depth of Saudi-Korean relations, pointing out the need for joint work to strengthen and develop them in various fields, especially the … relationship between the Shoura Council and the Korean Parliament,” the council said in a statement to Arab News. The Korean ambassador praised the Saudi Vision 2030 reform program, and said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to South Korea in 2019 opened up prospects for greater cooperation between the two countries. During this week’s meeting, the two sides stressed the need to initiate parliamentary visits between the two countries. In January, South Korean President Moon Jae-in visited Riyadh and held talks with the crown prince. They discussed ways to strengthen cooperation in various fields, including healthcare, science and technology. The Shoura Council’s parliamentary friendship committees work to strengthen ties between the council and the parliaments of friendly countries.
