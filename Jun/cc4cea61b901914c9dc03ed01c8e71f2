DUBAI: An emotional video capturing the moment a Saudi child hearing for the first time has gone viral among social media users in the Kingdom.
The video published by the Saudi health ministry in Najran late Saturday showed the smiling young boy, identified as Wajdy, break into laughter after hearing sound for the very first time.
The child underwent a cochlear implant operation in both ears at King Khalid Hospital in Najran, according to a post on the ministry’s Twitter account. 
The footage showed the giggling child seated on a couch as the doctor spoke to him and clapped his hands to test his hearing ability. لحظات من السعادة..
