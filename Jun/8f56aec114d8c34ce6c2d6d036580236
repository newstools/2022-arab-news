RIYADH: Yemeni President Rashad Al-Alimi on Sunday called for more efforts in defending Arab nation’s interests, including advocating the rights of the Yemeni people to restore their own state and eliminate a coup by the Houthi militia, the government’s Saba news agency said.
Al-Alimi was speaking during an Arab League session in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, where he praised the organization’s significant role and its united stance in support of Yemen, and stressed the important role of regional organizations in achieving peace, along with the UN and international community.
He said he hoped the mounting pressures on the Iran-backed Houthis would force them to fulfill their obligations under the UN-brokered truce agreement, including opening roads to Taiz and other cities, rescuing the Safer oil tanker to prevent unaffordable environmental disaster in the Red Sea, releasing prisoners and detainees, and paying salaries of employees in militia-controlled areas.
“The continuation of the cross-borders attacks constitute the most dangerous threat to the global energy supplies from the neighboring countries that have been very keen on maintaining Yemen’s security, stability, and ending its peoples’ suffering,” Al-Alimi said, in reference to Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
He also commended the Arab League’s decision to list the Houthis as a terrorist organization,and urged Arab countries to enforce this decision into effect immediately to deter the militia from committing further violations against the Yemeni people.
During his visit to Cairo, the Yemeni president also met with Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Abu Al-Gheit, where they discussed the latest development in the war-torn country.
