RIYADH: The Saudi Judicial Training Center held a graduation ceremony for 533 trainees, attended by Justice Minister Walid Al-Samaani and a number of officials and judges.
“The Judicial Training Center is proud of its role in developing the legal system and improving the proficiency of legal practitioners,” said Faris Al-Qarni, the center’s director.
“This is achieved by planning and implementing advanced training programs and enabling partners through a knowledge framework and governing standards.”
Al-Qarni said that the center aims to become a pioneering reference to contribute effectively to the justice system, upgrade training practices, and enhance institutional procedures.
He said that the center had accomplished much by developing first-rate qualification programs and issuing skill-building legal publications such as tools for interpreting legal texts and a guide to training management.
