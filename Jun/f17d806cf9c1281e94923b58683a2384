LONDON: Britain’s regulator on Wednesday approved Shell’s revised plan to develop a North Sea natural gas field as the government seeks to boost domestic energy output following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In a statement, Shell welcomed the decision and said it plans to move ahead with the development of the Jackdaw gas field which has the potential to produce 6.5 percent of Britain’s gas output. British Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng said the Jackdaw gas field had received final regulatory approval after it was initially rejected on environmental grounds last October. “Let’s source more of the gas we need from British waters to protect energy security,” Kwarteng said on Twitter. Reuters last week reported that Britain’s Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning was poised to approve the field’s new environmental development plans, a major milestone for a new development. Under the new plan, Shell plans to start production from the field in the second half of 2025.
