JEDDAH: Saudi nationals are eligible for a visa exemption to travel to Thailand, the Thai embassy said on Friday. The move means that Saudi passport holders can travel to Thailand without a visa and stay in the country for travel purposes for 30 days. On Thursday, the embassy’s website also announced the procedures for entry for Thai and foreign travelers from all countries, including Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. As of July 1, travelers no longer require a Thailand Pass or medical insurance to enter the country. Fully vaccinated persons must provide vaccination certificates. Unvaccinated persons must carry a negative RT-PCR test result or professional antigen test kit (ATK) result issued within 72 hours of travel. On the day of departure to Thailand, all foreign travelers should have the following documents in hard copy: Passport with Thai visa affixed or reentry permit stamped in the passport (Saudi citizens do not require a visa or reentry permit), airline ticket (a round-trip ticket in case of visa on arrival), vaccination certificate against COVID-19, or a negative RT-PCR test result or professional ATK result issued within 72 hours of travel. Those traveling to Thailand before July 1 must present a Thailand Pass and an insurance certificate with at least $10,000 coverage for medical treatment.
