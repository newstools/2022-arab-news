Zef ft. Stephanie Atala For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle ‘El Bekle’    The latest release from Lebanese singer-songwriter is a pop-tinged duet with Lebanese actress Stephanie Atala, with whom he co-starred in MBC’s “Confessions of a Fashionista.” “El Bekle” tells the story of “an unlikely first encounter, involving a lost hair clip and late-night phone calls, that grows into a beautiful love story,” according to a press release. Atala describes it as “light-hearted,” adding: “When your heart beats fast for something or someone, go for it!” Ahmad Haffar ‘Rated R’  Haffar’s first stand-up special launched on Starzplay on May 27. The 28-year-old’s PR folks are pushing him as ‘The Voice of Dubai,’ because he’s the voiceover artist behind numerous promotions and announcements around the emirate, including the metro. He’s now turned his hand to comedy, with a show focused on the peculiarities of Dubai and Lebanon, and a touch of dark humor beneath. Soolking ‘Sans Visa’    The Paris-based Algerian MC and singer has become one of the biggest French-speaking pop stars in the world over the past few years. His new album, released late last month, is a typically eclectic blend of rap, R&B, Algerian raï, and reggaeton. The album’s lead single, “Suavemente,” has already been a huge hit around the world, and with collabs with French artists Niska, Kendji Jirac, and Naps (among others) on the record, it’s unlikely to be the last track from the LP to storm the charts. Rima Yussef ‘Ohebuka Raghman’    Lebanese star Rima Yussef’s new single was helmed by multi-award-winning producer Omar Sabbagh. According to a press release from Universal Music MENA, the song “tells the story of how one sacrifices and fights for love — even if the love might be one-sided.” The accompanying music video, directed by Ramy Nabha, has already racked up almost 4 million views on YouTube.
