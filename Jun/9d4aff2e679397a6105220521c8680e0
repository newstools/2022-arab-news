CAIRO: An Egyptian-led international team of paleontologists has discovered the fossil of a predatory dinosaur that lived about 98 million years ago in the Bahariya Oasis in Egypt’s Western Desert. The team found the fossil during a joint field trip between the Mansoura University Vertebrate Paleontology Center and scientists from the Ministry of Environment. Mansoura University President Ashraf Abdel Basset said the fossil is from an Abel dinosaur, which is very similar to the Tyrannosaurus rex.
