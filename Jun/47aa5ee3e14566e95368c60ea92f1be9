RIYADH: AlSagr Cooperative Insurance Co.’s shareholders are seeking the dismissal of four board members, including the vice-chairman. The Saudi-listed insurer said in a bourse filing that the request was received from multiple shareholders — with an almost 6.9 percent stake — asking for a general assembly meeting to vote on the dismissal. The current vice-chairman is Majed Alserri, while the three board members in question are Abdullah Alserri, Abdulmohsen Jaber, and Sultan Alswaidi. Earlier in the day, the Saudi Exchange placed a trading halt on AlSagr’s shares until it announces its financial statements for the first quarter of 2022.
