LONDON: The Ministry of Justice in Tunisia announced on Sunday that it will continue to order judges' salaries cut to take account of strike days. Tunisian judges are on strike for the fourth week in a row in protest of President Kais Saied's dismissal of 57 judges. Four judges' unions declared a general strike on June 6, claiming that Saied fired their colleagues “without the slightest recourse to disciplinary procedures,” in violation of the constitution, according to the Association of Tunisian Magistrates. Almost 99 percent of judges in Tunisia have decided to strike, as reported by the association. While Saaed has accused the dismissed judges of corruption and protecting terrorists, the Association has said that his decision said were mostly politically motivated. Despite salaries being cut since the strike began, Anas Hamadi, president of the association, stated that the strike will continue until judges are reinstated.
