ABU DHABI: Abu Dhabi Media, the UAE-based public broadcaster and media company, has appointed streaming platform Starzplay to exclusively handle advertising sales and commercial services for its entire portfolio. As part of the long-term deal, Starzplay, supported by its shareholder E-Vision, will manage ADM’s commercial and advertising deals in all general entertainment fields, including TV, radio, digital and publishing, across the Middle East and North Africa region and beyond. The partnership will “contribute significantly to enhancing Abu Dhabi Media’s commercial proposition” and support the company’s “mission to further extend our reach to new commercial partners in line with our strategic priorities, while also being able to create new opportunities with our existing advertisers,” said Abdulraheem Alnuaimi, ADM’s general manager. Starzplay already has a “long-standing relationship” with ADM and the deal “further strengthens our market leadership and we look forward to offering cutting-edge solutions to our partners, in conjunction with our shareholder E-Vision,” said Danny Bates, Starzplay’s co-founder and chief commercial officer. Further to the agreement, Starzplay has assembled an internal advertising-sales business team, led by Hamad Malik, and plans to expand its sales network across the Gulf Cooperation Council region. “The market is continuously evolving and, as leaders in the industry, we have always striven to innovate and evolve with the changing trends,” Bates added. “The addition of advertising sales is a long-term strategic decision and we look forward to exploring multiple opportunities in this space.”
