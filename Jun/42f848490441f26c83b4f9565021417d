MADINAH: Madinah Gov. and chairman of the Madinah Development Authority Prince Faisal bin Salman visited the King Salman Urban Charter Exhibition organized by the Architecture and Design Commission as part of the Madinah Book Fair. Prince Faisal heard an explanation about the international and local award-winning projects exhibited at the fair, which have preserved the country’s cultural values and established the culture and authenticity of the Kingdom’s various regions, the Saudi Press Agency reported. The governor praised the fair for its reflection of the creative architectural philosophy that started with King Salman’s idea in the 1970s related to the development of Riyadh and achieved models of architectural masterpieces in the capital, such as the Masmak Fortress, King Abdulaziz Historical Center, Tuwaiq Palace, Al-Kindi Plaza, King Khalid International Airport, the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the King Fahd National Library. He said the exhibition emphasized King Salman’s perspective on the architectural uniqueness of Saudi buildings that distinguished them from those found in the rest of the world.
