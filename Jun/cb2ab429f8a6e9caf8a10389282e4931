CAIRO: Yemen’s warring parties resumed talks Sunday on reopening roads in Taiz and other provinces, the United Nations said, after they agreed to renew a nationwide cease-fire.
The UN mission to Yemen said delegations from the internationally recognized government and the Iran-backed Houthis began their second round of direct discussion in the Jordanian capital of Amman.
The mission did not provide further details.
The two sides did not reach an agreement on lifting the militia's blockade of Taiz, Yemen’s third largest city, in their first round of talks late last month.
Reopening the roads around Taiz and elsewhere in Yemen is part of a truce the UN brokered early in April. It was the first nationwide cease-fire in in six years in Yemen’s brutal conflict, now in its eighth year.
The Houthis have imposed a siege on government-held city of Taiz, the capital of the province by the same name, since March 2016.
The two sides agreed on Thursday to extend the truce for more two months after concerted pressure from the UN and international aid groups.
