CAIRO: Egypt will host a major tripartite forum next month to strengthen a wide-ranging industrial partnership with the UAE and Jordan. Egyptian Minister of Trade and Industry Nevin Gamea said that industry ministers from the three countries will chair the meeting, which will focus on joint food and drug security, as well as stepping up cooperation in investment, agriculture, fertilizers, textiles, minerals and petrochemicals. The meeting follows the signing of an integrated industrial partnership initiative between Egypt, the UAE and Jordan. Gamea’s announcement came during a remote meeting with Sultan Al-Jaber, minister of advanced industries in the UAE, and Youssef Al-Shamali, Jordan’s minister of industry, trade and supply. He said that the three countries were seeking to facilitate procedures for doing business, as well as remove any obstacles standing in the way of the flow of capital and trade. The integrated industrial partnership initiative for sustainable economic development was signed between the UAE, Jordan and Egypt last week in Abu Dhabi in the presence of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, deputy prime minister and minister of presidential affairs in the UAE; Jordanian Prime Minister Bishr Al-Khasawneh; and Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly. The initiative aims to develop joint industrial projects, as well as encouraging self-sufficiency and ensuring food security.
