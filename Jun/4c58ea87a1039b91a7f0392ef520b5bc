DUBAI: The UAE reported an additional 1,489 daily COVID-19 infections on Sunday as cases have consistently breached the 1,000 mark since June 9. Aggregate cases in the country now stand at 927,387 with deaths at 2,309 after a COVID-19 related fatality was reported, while 908,145 individuals have fully recovered from the virus. Health authorities earlier blamed the ‘lack of commitment of people’ in keeping with safety regulations that remain in place, including the wearing of masks indoors as well as the failure of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 to undergo mandatory isolation. The Ministry of Health and Prevention warned that those caught not wearing mask indoors would be fined $816 (3,000 dirhams), and that the regulation would be strictly implemented. The UAE has one of the world’s highest COVID-19 vaccination levels, with 24,922,054 jabs given so far since the pandemic started, or about 251.98% of doses administered per 100 people.
