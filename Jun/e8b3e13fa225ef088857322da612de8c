ADEN: The Saudi Development and Reconstruction Program for Yemen has started implementing a housing project in Aden. The first phase of the project, in partnership with the Alwaleed Philanthropies and UN-Habitat, includes 80 locations for housing in the Al-Mualla district out of 600 total housing units that will be rehabilitated in Aden. It aims to provide proper living conditions for Yemeni families by repairing minor to medium damage to housing as well as sewage facilities. The project also includes a special program to train Yemeni personnel in the housing sector. It will develop the capabilities of 40 engineers in advanced geographical information systems, project management, specialized procurements, calculating project costs, as well as technical and economic feasibility studies. About 200 training opportunities will also be provided in electrical engineering, solar energy, photography and construction drawing. This project is part of 207 development schemes and initiatives that the SDRPY has implemented across the country to target seven main sectors: Education, health, water, energy, transport, agriculture and fisheries.
