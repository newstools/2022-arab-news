RIYADH: The Human Rights Commission, in partnership with the UN International Organization for Migration, recently concluded a two-day anti-trafﬁcking training program for the Kingdom’s Border Guard. More than 100 Border Guard personnel were given training by specialists from the IOM, the UN Ofﬁce on Drugs and Crime, the UN Refugee Agency, UNICEF, UN Human Rights Office and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The program included an overview of national and global frameworks for combating trafﬁcking, as well as a discussion of the indicators of trafﬁcking, national referral mechanisms, humanitarian border management, protection of potential trafﬁcking victims, children in mixed migration, and best practices in border management. Sarah Altamimi, HRC deputy president for international cooperation and vice chair of the National Committee to Combat Trafﬁcking in Persons, said that the program is one of the commitments made under the Kingdom’s national action plan to combat trafﬁcking, which outlines its strategy to fight crime and provide support to the victims. She said that the Human Rights Commission continues working through the committee, which consists of several government entities, including the Ministry of Interior, to strengthen the Kingdom’s anti-trafﬁcking “toolbox,” which also involves specialists’ training. Mohamed El Zarkani, chief of mission of the IOM in Bahrain, said: “We as partner organizations see this as an example and commend existing efforts to strengthen it with the aim of protecting vulnerable people, marginalized groups and children at risk in accordance with best practices and international standards.”
