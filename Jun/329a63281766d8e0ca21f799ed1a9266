LOS ANGELES: Season four of Netflix series “Stranger Things” is this week’s hot topic. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle Both new and returning cast members remember how the series turned pop culture upside down when it debuted as the service’s third most streamed show in 2016. Now, with the series’ fifth season confirmed to be its finale, “Stranger Things” season four is setting the stage with new characters, new monsters and more secrets to be uncovered. The characters are dealing with losses and find themselves separated, splitting the show’s focus between the familiar small town of Hawkins, sunny California and a remote Russian prison. In an interview with Arab News, US actor Brett Gelman, who plays the role of a former investigative journalist Murray Bauman, said that season four is “the best season yet.”   “I think it’s the funniest and scariest season yet, and I think that (the audience) are going to be able to see a lot of their favorite characters develop in ways that they have never anticipated,” he added. US actress Maya Hawke, who plays Robin Buckley in the show, credited the creators, actors and the art, makeup and hair departments for the show’s success. “Everyone who makes it from the creators to the actors to the art department to hair and makeup are dorks. (There are) a lot of dorks and geeks and people who deeply, deeply love what they do,” Hawke told Arab News. “If the people who come together to make it love what they’re doing, that’s great filmmaking and great storytelling,” she added. Meanwhile, US actress Natalia Dyer believes that one of the best things about the show “is how they throw different characters together in different situations.” “I think everybody’s characters grew a bit from that experience which is so fun to play,” Dyer explained. With seven episodes already available and two more dropping this July, including a feature film length finale, fans have a lot to look forward to.
