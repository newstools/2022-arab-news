RIYADH: More than 33,000 jobs are set to be created for Saudi nationals after the government announced the latest wave of its "Saudization" program. The Kingdom's Minister of Human Resources and Social Development, Ahmed Al-Rajhi, has issued a notification nationalizing a number of professions and economic activities — including licensed aviation professions, opticians, periodic inspection activity, and postal service outlets. Parcel transportation, customer service professionals, and sales outlets in seven economic activities were also included in the announcement. The decision to localize licensed aviation professions will be implemented in two phases with the first one starting from March 15, 2023. The decision also applies to all private sector establishments that employ five or more employees in aviation-related jobs.
