Saudi Arabia have reached the semifinals of the 2022 WAFF Futsal Championship after beating Iraq 3-2 at the Al-Naser Club Hall in Kuwait. Organized by the West Asia Football Federation, the fourth edition of the tournament had the Green Falcons competing in a group that included hosts Kuwait and Palestine. The win sees the national team in the last four following a 2-1 win over Palestine in their opener, and a 5-4 setback in their second match against the hosts, who topped Group A to also progress. Iraq took an early one-goal lead but two strikes by Abdulelah Al-Otaibi and one by Saleh Al-Qarni were ultimately enough to see Saudi progress. The Saudi team’s semifinals opponent will be determined after Thursday’s conclusion of Group B, which includes Bahrain, Lebanon, Oman and the UAE.
