TOKYO: Japan and the UAE confirmed their cooperation on the energy market, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said on Tuesday.
“METI Minister Hagiuda Koichi held a video conference with Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to discuss working toward stability in the international crude oil market. The two ministers also discussed stronger bilateral cooperation in the clean energy field, of hydrogen, fuel ammonia, and CCUS,” the ministry said.
During the meeting, held last week, Minister Hagiuda expressed his gratitude for the reliable supply of crude oil to Japan, despite Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other factors keeping crude oil prices high. He asked for cooperation toward stabilization of the international crude oil market by ensuring an ample supply through increased production and investment in capacity investment.
The two ministers welcomed the progress on the ongoing hydrogen project under the Memorandum of Cooperation on Hydrogen signed by their governments last April.
Hagiuda and Al Mazrouei agreed to work closely on maintaining the strong relationship that is marked this year with the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations being established between their countries.
