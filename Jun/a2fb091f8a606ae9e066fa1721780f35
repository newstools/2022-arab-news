King Salman Global Academy for Arabic Language on Saturday will hold the closing ceremony of the “Arabic Hackathon,” the most prominent challenge internationally in processing the Arabic language automatically. The academy launched the hackathon to invent technical solutions, digital platforms and specialized tools that serve the Arabic language and enhance its status among the world’s living languages​. A total of 151 projects submitted by more than 1,030 participants from 40 countries around the world compete to win awards totaling more than SR1 million ($270,000), distributed over 22 prizes. Of the 22 prizes, 12 will be allocated for the first three tracks, including the Arabic poetry challenge, lexicon challenge, and the challenge of language games for children, with four prizes for the first four places in each track. The other 10 prizes will be distributed to winners of each innovative idea project, with two prizes for each project. The award’s criteria include accuracy of the application in providing results and outputs, and the impact and added value of the idea. The closing ceremony will be accompanied by an exhibition in which the strategic partners of the Arabic Hackathon will participate, offering the winners an opportunity to showcase their projects and initiatives, and introducing visitors to the technical aspects and the impact of their projects on the Arabic language.
