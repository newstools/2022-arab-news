Four WWE championship title matches have been lined up for this year’s Money in the Bank show taking place in Las Vegas on Saturday, July 2. The event already has a star-studded match-card confirmed, with Bianca Belair set to defend her Raw Women’s Championship against Carmella. Belair’s opponent fought through the Fatal 5-Way contest against Alexa Bliss, Asuka, Liv Morgan, and Becky Lynch to earn the title chance. The evening will also see the resurgent Ronda Rousey face off with Natalya for the SmackDown Women’s Championship, as the former UFC star looks to maintain her dominance, and hold on to her champion’s status following an explosive return to WWE earlier this year. Elsewhere, The Street Profits will attempt to break up the Undisputed Tag Team Champions The Usos’ winning streak at this year’s Money in the Bank after a series of collisions in recent weeks. Also confirmed is the US Championship match, which will see Austin Theory bring his signature confidence, along with his championship belt, as he stands against Bobby Lashley on July 2. Following a thrilling series of contests with Omos, Lashley will have his eyes firmly focused on taking the national title away from Theory.
