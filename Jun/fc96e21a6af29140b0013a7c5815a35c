RIYADH: Saudi authorities on Wednesday foiled an attempt to smuggle millions of highly addictive and illegal amphetamine pills into the country. Maj. Mohammed Al-Nujaidi, spokesperson for the General Directorate of Narcotics Control, said that over 3.5 million Captagon tablets were found hidden in a shipment of stones and gardening supplies at Jeddah Islamic Port. The authorities arrested three Turkish residents, a resident, an expatriate on a visitor’s visa, a Syrian expatriate on an Umrah visa, and four citizens. They have been referred to the Public Prosecution authority. The operation was carried out in cooperation with the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority. The Ministry of Interior and various security agencies, working with the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority, continues to target those trying to smuggle drugs into the country.
