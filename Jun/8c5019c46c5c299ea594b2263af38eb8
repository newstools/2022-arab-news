RIYADH: The General Directorate of Passports’ field teams for this year’s Hajj can communicate with pilgrims in 13 languages, including English, Spanish, Indonesian, Japanese, Persian, Urdu, Turkish, Portuguese, and Bangladeshi. The field teams have been deployed at Jeddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport and Madinah’s Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport. Saudi Arabia has permitted up to 1 million people to join the Hajj this year, inviting pilgrims from foreign countries for the first time in two years, after COVID-19 restrictions saw the annual pilgrimage limited to residents of the Kingdom.
