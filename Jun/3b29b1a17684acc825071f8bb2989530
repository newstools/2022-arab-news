LONDON: Thailand has exempted Saudi citizens from entry visas for a 30-day stay, Saudi Arabia’s embassy in Thailand announced on Tuesday. The embassy said the visa exemption period set by the Thai government also came without any fees. The implementation date of the decision to allow the Saudis to enter Thailand without a visa will be announced soon, the embassy added. Citizens entering Thailand must provide a medical insurance certificate for an amount of at least $20,000 via insurance offices, the embassy revealed in March. Travelers must also attach a hotel reservation for one day, as well as quarantine in one of the approved hotels by the Thai Ministry of Health until the result of a COVID-19 PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before the arrival date is received. Saudi Arabia and Thailand announced in January a restoration of full diplomatic ties and a planned exchange of ambassadorsa after 32 years.
