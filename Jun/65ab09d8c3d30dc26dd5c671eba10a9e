RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center on Saturday launched a voluntary medical campaign to combat blindness and its diseases in Sudan, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Sunday.
The project was launched in the southwestern city of Nyala, in South Darfur, in cooperation with the Sudanese Al-Basar International Foundation.
The center’s volunteer medical team has detected 2,500 cases to date, performed 270 surgeries, and distributed 950 spectacles.
The campaign is an extension of Saudi Arabia’s projects, implemented by KSrelief, to combat blindness for low income families in a number of countries.
