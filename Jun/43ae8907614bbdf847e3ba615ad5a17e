Saudi Arabia drew 0-0 with Japan in their second match of the 2022 AFC U23 Asian Cup at Pakhtakor Stadium in Tashkent, on Monday night. The result means the Young Falcons, with four points from two outings, remain top of Group D on goal difference from Japan, while the UAE, who beat Tajikistan 2-0 on the same day, are in third with three points. The two teams played attacking football throughout the match but neither could break the deadlock. The Saudi team were given a boost in the 79th minute when Shota Fujio was sent off for a foul on Awad Al-Nashri following the intervention of VAR, but couldn’t take advantage of their numerical advantage. Saudi Arabia and Japan’s under-23 teams have previously played to two other 0-0 stalemates, in the Asian Olympic qualifiers of September and October 2007. Saudi’s next match is against the UAE on Thursday, June 9, with Japan kicking off against Tajikistan at the same time.
