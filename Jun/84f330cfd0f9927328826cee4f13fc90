CAIRO: Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry has called for economic integration between his country, Iraq and Jordan. This would be of both economic and political benefit, he said during a press conference with his Iraqi and Jordanian counterparts in Baghdad. “Economic integration among us is important for … joint projects, and benefits the peoples of these countries in terms of providing job opportunities and advancing the economy,” he added, citing infrastructural integration as particularly important. Shoukry and his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi met with leaders and senior officials in the Iraqi capital.
