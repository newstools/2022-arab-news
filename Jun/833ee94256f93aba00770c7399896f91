UAE: The UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention has confirmed four new cases of monkeypox, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.
The detection comes nearly 10 days after the country reported the first case of the virus in a 29-year-old female who arrived from West Africa, bringing the total number of cases in the UAE to eight.
No further details about subsequent cases were provided.
In a statement, the ministry said the country’s health authorities were taking the necessary precautionary measures to detect the virus early and monitor close contacts of patients.
It had earlier announced a quarantine procedure of  “no less than 21 days” for close contacts of infected individuals. Confirmed cases will be treated at hospitals in isolation until they recover. 
The ministry urged the UAE community to follow the appropriate safety measures while travelling or engaging in large crowds or gatherings.
“Monkeypox is a viral disease, but usually a self-limited one, if compared to COVID-19,” the ministry’s statement read.
“It’s mostly transmitted to humans through close contact with an infected person or animal, including bodily fluids, and respiratory droplets, or with material contaminated with the virus. It can also be passed to the baby in the womb." Countries across the world have been scaling up detection and response to the viral disease. Over 550 cases have so far been reported in 30 countries.
