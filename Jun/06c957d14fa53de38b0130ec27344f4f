KUWAIT: Kuwait's crown prince has suffered from a bout of illness but is in good health, state news agency KUNA said on Tuesday.
Crown Prince Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah required temporary rest after falling ill, KUNA cited an emiri court statement as saying. Last November, Kuwait Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah handed over most of his responsibilities to the crown prince, his designated heir. (with Reuters)
