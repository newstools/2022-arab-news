BERLIN: Sadio Mane signed autographs wearing a Bayern Munich shirt Tuesday after flying to Germany for a medical check before the Liverpool forward completes a move to the Bundesliga champions.
Broadcaster Sky showed footage of the 30-year-old touching down at Munich airport before being taken to a hospital in the city center for a medical exam by Bayern’s team doctor.
During a break in the medical test, Mane appeared in a red Bayern training shirt and signed autographs for waiting fans.
According to media reports, Mane’s transfer will cost Bayern around 41 million euros (£35 million, $43 million).
“I am happy he has landed,” Thomas Mueller said while attending a golf tournament in Munich on Tuesday.
Bayern’s German international forward joked that he soon hopes to see Mane hit “lots of birdies” on the city’s courses.

Mane would be a replacement for wantaway Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski, who has been linked to a Barcelona transfer, or winger Serge Gnabry, who is stalling over a contract extension.
