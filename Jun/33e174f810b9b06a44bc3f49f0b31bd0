RIYADH: Indonesian Hajj pilgrims continue to benefit from the Makkah Route initiative by having their travel procedures facilitated at Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. The initiative has been welcomed by and received praise from pilgrims in Indonesia who have commended the Kingdom’s efforts to serve pilgrims and provide them with the highest level of services so that they can perform Hajj comfortably.   The initiative seeks to offer the highest level of services to pilgrims by completing their entry procedures to Saudi Arabia in airports in their home countries. Upon arrival in the Kingdom, they are received at a special lounge and transported to their residences without waiting at the airport. Five countries are featured in the initiative: Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Morocco, and Bangladesh.
