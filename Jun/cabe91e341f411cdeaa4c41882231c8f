We now recognize that the shows we had booked do not honor that sentiment.” The four-member group clarified that they oppose the “illegal occupation and systematic oppression of the Palestinian people. “We believe in total freedom and self-determination for all Palestinians,” they wrote to their 46,500 followers.
