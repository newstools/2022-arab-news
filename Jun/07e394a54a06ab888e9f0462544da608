Algeria coach Djamel Belmadi has denied rumors that several players, led by captain Riyad Mahrez, will retire from international football. The talk has been fuelled by their absence from the team’s most recent matches. Quoted by the official Algerian Football Federation website, Belmadi said on Monday: “So far, no player in the national team has officially announced his retirement. I am not seeking to end any player’s career with the national team.” The 2019 Africa Cup of Nations champions started their qualifying campaign for the 2023 edition with victories over Uganda and Tanzania, and a 2-1 win over Iraq in a friendly in Qatar. “The absence of some players from the last matches was due to injury, such as Riyad Mahrez and Said Benrahma,” said Belmadi. He also said that since Djamel Benlamri and Sofiane Feghouli were both free agents, they had been out of action for a considerable time and lacked match fitness. “These players have done a lot for the national team, and they are still in our consideration,” Belmadi added. “The goal of having so many names involved is to compete and have a strong national team.”
