CAIRO: Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit has expressed concern over clashes that took place between armed groups in Libya’s capital Tripoli on Friday and Saturday. He urged all parties to preserve and adhere to a ceasefire agreement that includes the withdrawal of mercenaries and foreign fighters from the country. Aboul Gheit warned against the return of resorting to arms in Libya, which he said had not benefited any party, and had resulted in bloodshed and wasting of the country’s resources. He also called for national elections to be held “as soon as possible.”
