LONDON: The UK government said on Thursday that it is not “currently considering” plans to implement a universal charger following the EU’s decision to unify chargers by autumn 2024 The provisional EU agreement, which was announced on Tuesday, will enforce a USB-C on all new portable electronic devices, including phones, tablets and laptops. “A common charger is common sense for the many electronic devices in our daily lives,” Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said in a statement. “European consumers will be able to use a single charger for all their portable electronics — an important step to increase convenience and reduce waste,” he added. According to reports, the post-Brexit agreement between the UK and EU stipulates that the new regulation should apply to Northern Ireland. The ruling means that all companies, including tech giants Apple and Google, will be obliged to make devices such as phones, tablets, e-readers and digital cameras use the USB-C charger. According to the EU, the new order also takes into account a range of other portable electronic devices, including video game console controllers, headphone and headsets, portable speakers and power-banks. The law is a part of a wider EU effort to make products in the region more sustainable, reduce electronic waste and make consumers’ lives easier. This move is especially concerning to Apple, which said in a statement on Tuesday that the new regulation will curb innovation. However, according to the EU, the ruling will save consumers “up to €250 million ($268 million) a year on unnecessary charger purchases” and cut 11,000 tons of waste a year.
