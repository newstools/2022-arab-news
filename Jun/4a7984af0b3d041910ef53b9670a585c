Riyadh is the latest metropolis to join the brand’s City Releases, a collection of limited release Fred Perry shirts inspired by its global shop locations.   The release coincides with the 70th anniversary of the polo shirt first launched by legendary tennis star Fred Perry in the 1950s. The British heritage house is marking the special occasion with a new exhibition, titled “Fred Perry: A British Icon” at the Design Museum in London. In other Fred Perry news, the Wimbledon-founded label this week teamed up with Palestinian-Israeli brand Adish to curate a collection that shines a spotlight on the unique and skilled embroidery work in Palestine. A post shared by Fred Perry (@fredperry) The collection includes the brand’s signature polo shirt, ringer shirt, sweatshirt, track jacket and track pants, which have all been hand-embroidered by female artisans in a village in Palestine. Adish is a collaborative effort between Israelis Amit Luzon and Eyal Eliyahu, Palestinian-American artist Jordan Nassar and Palestinian Ramallah-based Qussay K to counter the systematic erasure of Palestinian cultural heritage by adding traditional Tatreez embroidery to contemporary, unisex designs.
