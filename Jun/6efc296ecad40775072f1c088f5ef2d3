RIYADH: Arab National Bank’s board has proposed a dividend payout of SR750 million ($200 million) for the first half of 2022 following strong earnings in the first quarter of the year. It will distribute SR0.5 per share dividend to 1.5 billion eligible shares on July 18, according to a bourse filing. The Saudi lender had earlier posted a 12-percent surge in its quarterly profit to SR650 million, from SR582 million in the same period last year. The profit growth was primarily attributed to higher gains from special commissions, financing, and investment activities, along with a rise in net exchange and trading income. Founded in 1979, Riyadh-based Arab National Bank is one of the 10 largest in the Middle East, operating through 156 branches in the Kingdom.
