RIYADH: Bangladesh’s Minister of State for Religious Affairs Mohammed Faridul Haque Khan has praised the Kingdom’s efforts to facilitate Hajj and Umrah rituals for pilgrims, Saudi Press Agency reported on Sunday. The minister highlighted the Kingdom’s keenness to ensure pilgrims are able to perform rituals comfortably, and expressed appreciation to the authorities for their cooperation and role in the success of the Makkah Route initiative. The Makkah Route initiative is part of Saudi Arabia's Guests of God Service Program and seeks to provide visitors to the holy sites with the finest possible services to help them perform their Hajj rituals easily and comfortably. Five countries are featured in the initiative: Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Morocco, and Bangladesh. It includes issuing visas, ensuring compliance with health requirements, and codifying and sorting luggage at airports in the home countries of pilgrims. Pilgrims arriving from these countries can bypass entry procedures on their arrival in the Kingdom, go directly to the buses waiting for them, and travel to their accommodation in Makkah and Madinah. Their luggage is handled and delivered directly to them at their accommodation.
