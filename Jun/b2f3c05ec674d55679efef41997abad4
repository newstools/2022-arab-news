RIYADH: Hydrogen plays a crucial role in UAE’s energy transition as the country aims to achieve the target of net-zero by 2050, according to Energy Minister Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei. While speaking at a virtual conference during the MEA Energy Week, he highlighted that the UAE has built the region’s first green hydrogen plant in partnership with Siemens Energy. The transport sector also demands diversification and it should explore possibilities with hydrogen as the prices of traditional fuels are rising dramatically, the minister noted. “Together we can make a difference and we will,” said Al Mazrouei. To achieve the net-zero goal by 2050, he emphasized that consumption should be reduced, “both as a country and as an individual.” The minister further noted that the energy sector should make use of technology to yield better results.
