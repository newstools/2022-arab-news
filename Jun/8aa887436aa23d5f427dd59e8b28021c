Jordan’s Prime Minister Bishr Khasawneh confirmed on Wednesday that the results of the investigation into the deadly gas leak in Aqaba will be shared “transparently and objectively,” state news agency Petra reported. 
At least 13 people were killed, and 250 others were hospitalized when a chlorine tank exploded after a crane dropped it at the Red Sea port of Aqaba, releasing a large plume of toxic yellow smoke.   According to the prime minister, authorities have reached the advanced stages of the investigation and are working “around the clock to reach full results about the incident,” the Petra report added. 
 During the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Khasawneh also expressed condolences to the families of the Aqaba port victims and wished a speedy recovery for those injured.
 He praised the efforts of state institutions in containing the gas leak, adding that all efforts were done under the supervision and guidance of King Abdullah II and Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II. 
 King Abdullah II had on Tuesday called for those responsible for the leak to be held accountable, stressing the need “to provide transparent explanations to the public after investigations conclude, as well as identifying shortcomings and holding those responsible to account by law,” according to a statement by his palace.
