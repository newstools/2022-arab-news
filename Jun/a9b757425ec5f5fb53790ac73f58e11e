Four-time major champion and former world number-one Brooks Koepka has joined LIV Golf and will compete in the tour’s Golf Invitational Portland, kicking off June 30 at Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club in Oregon. “There’s no understating the impact that Brooks Koepka has had on the game of golf in the last five years. He carries a championship pedigree and record of success as one of the most elite players in the world,” said Greg Norman, LIV Golf CEO and commissioner. “The addition of Brooks is yet another example of the incredible fields LIV Golf is assembling as we build momentum in our first season and look towards the future.” One of the game’s most dominant players in recent years, Koepka is the first golfer in history to simultaneously hold back-to-back titles in two different majors — the US Open in 2017 and 2018, and the PGA Championship in 2018 and 2019. He was the first player in three decades to win consecutive US Opens and held the world number-one ranking for 47 consecutive weeks, during which he continued to add to his list of career victories, now standing at 15. Koepka has accumulated 72 top-10 finishes, has made four US national team appearances including three Ryder Cups, and is currently ranked at 19 in the world. The LIV Golf Invitational Series launched June 9 to a worldwide audience showcasing its new, innovative format with 12 teams, 48 players, shotgun starts and no cut. LIV Golf is owned and operated by LIV Golf Investments whose stated vision and mission are centered around making sustainable investments to enhance the global golf ecosystem and unlock the sport’s untapped worldwide potential.
