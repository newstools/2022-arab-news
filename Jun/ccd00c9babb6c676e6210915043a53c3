KHARTOUM: Sudan recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the UAE for a large agricultural project linked by a road to a new port to be built on the Red Sea, Sudanese Finance Minister Jibril Ibrahim said on Wednesday. The two sides were now working on the details of the project, Ibrahim told Reuters in an interview, without elaborating. The country has significant untapped agricultural potential, though some previous foreign investments have come up against local resistance and logistical problems.
