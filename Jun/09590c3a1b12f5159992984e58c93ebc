RIYADH: Oman’s Duqm refinery works are nearly 92 percent complete, according to the country’s state energy holding company OQ. The estimated $7 billion project saw 91.86 percent progress on engineering, procurement and construction by the end of May, OQ said in a social media post. The mechanical completion of the project could, however, be delayed to 2023 due to issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Kuwait Petroleum International CEO, Nawaf Saud al-Sabah, told MEED in an interview in April 2021. The formal groundbreaking ceremony for the project was held in April 2018. A joint venture between OQ and KPI, Duqm Refinery & Petrochemicals Industries Co., is the operator of the project. The Duqm refinery project is expected to have the capacity to refine 230,000 barrels a day of crude to primarily produce diesel, naphtha, jet fuel and liquefied petroleum gas, according to MEED. The EPC works at Duqm refinery are divided into three separate packages. The scope of EPC package one includes the process units, and it was won by a JV of Spain’s Tecnidas Reunidas and South Korea’s Daewoo Engineering & Construction. EPC package two comprises the utilities and offsite facilities and was awarded to UK-based Petrofac and South Korea’s Samsung Engineering. EPC package three includes the product export terminal at Duqm port, the Duqm refinery dedicated crude storage tanks at Ras Markaz and the 80-kilometer interconnecting pipeline from these tanks to the refinery. The third parcel went to a JV of Italy’s Saipem and US-based Chicago Bridge & Iron, a subsidiary of McDermott International.
