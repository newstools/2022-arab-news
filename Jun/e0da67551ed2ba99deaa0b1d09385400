RIYADH: The UN’s special envoy arrived in Yemen on Wednesday for talks on reopening routes to the Houthi-besieged city of Taiz. Hans Grundberg flew into the capital Sanaa less than a week after the truce in Yemen was renewed for a second period of two months. He commended the extension and said it was a “positive signal of the parties’ seriousness to uphold and implement the truce.” Grundberg continued on landing at Sanaa Airport: “Yemenis have seen the truce’s tangible benefits. We have witnessed a significant positive shift and we have a responsibility to safeguard it and deliver on its potential for peace in Yemen.” The UN envoy expressed hope that “constructive discussions” would be held on “our proposal for reopening roads in Taiz and other governorates, as well as economic and humanitarian measures, and the way forward.”
