MADRID: Sevilla was in danger of losing ground in the fight for second place in the Spanish league after being held at home by relegation-threatened Cádiz to 1-1 on Friday. The draw moved Sevilla a point ahead of Barcelona, who can regain second place when they host Mallorca on Sunday. Sevilla are three points ahead of Atlético Madrid, who hold the final Champions League place. Atlético visit Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. Second place is important because it guarantees a spot in the lucrative Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia. Leaders Real Madrid are 14 points clear at the top and need  a draw from their last five matches to clinch their second league title in three seasons. Their first chance to lift the trophy is on Saturday against Espanyol at home. Youssef En-Nesyri put Sevilla ahead with a header in the seventh minute at Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán Stadium, but the visitors equalized with a well-struck free kick taken by Lucas Pérez in the 66th. Cádiz stayed two points clear of the relegation zone ahead of the weekend matches. It can be overtaken by Granada, who host  Celta Vigo on Sunday. Cádiz lost two of their last four league matches, with a win at Barcelona two rounds ago.
