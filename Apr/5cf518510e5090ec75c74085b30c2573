RIYADH: Saudi Arabia on Monday condemned the “deliberate” abuse of the Holy Qur'an, as well as provocations and incitement against Muslims by some extremists in Sweden.
In a statement, the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed the importance of concerted efforts to spread the values of dialogue, tolerance, and coexistence.
The statement also emphasized renouncing hatred, extremism, and exclusion.
The Kingdom highlighted the efforts to prevent abuse of all religions and holy sites, the statement said.
Three people in the Swedish city of Norrkoping needed medical attention after being hit by police bullets during clashes between police and protesters following Qur'an burnings that caused riots in several Swedish towns over the Easter weekend.
In some places counter-protesters attacked police ahead of planned right-wing extremist demonstrations. Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has condemned the violence.
"Three people seem to have been hit by ricochets and are now being cared for in hospital. All three injured are arrested on suspicion of crime," Swedish police said in a online statement, adding that none of the injuries were life-threatening.
Police said the situation in Norrkoping was calm on Sunday evening.
Police and protesters have been engaged in serious clashes during the past days, resulting in several police suffering injuries and multiple vehicles torched.
The violence began on Thursday after a demonstration organized by Rasmus Paludan, leader of the Danish far-right political party Hard Line. 
Paludan, who had permission for a series of demonstrations across Sweden during the Easter weekend, is known for Qur'an burnings. (With Reuters)
