DUBAI: Joining the extensive line-up of designers to create exclusive collections primed for Ramadan, Milan-based fashion brand Off-White has launched its new capsule collection in celebration of the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle With the idea of modest dressing and comfort at the forefront of the collection, the 17-piece offering was made with the Middle Eastern consumer in mind.   Keeping in line with the holy month, the collection offers different interpretations of long hemlines and relaxed silhouettes for its modest-dressing customers, including rhinestone-embellished hoodies and T-shirts, track jackets and pants, satin shirts, knitwear and emerald-tone pajama sets that are equal parts stylish and comfortable. The capsule also features accessories in the form of a Swarovski necklace and matching earrings in Off-White’s ubiquitous arrow cross motif, glitter-infused slippers and satin bags. Those who wish to shop the new capsule collection can purchase pieces online and in select Off-White stores in the Gulf Cooperation Council, including in Riyadh, with prices ranging from $700 to $1850.   Off-White’s new Ramadan collection signals the growing focus luxury brands have in the burgeoning Middle Eastern market. Other luxury labels that have recently created collections specifically for Muslim consumers during Ramadan include Louis Vuitton, Michael Kors, Tory Burch and more. This is not the first time that the cult streetwear label celebrates the holy month. Last year, the late Off-White founder Virgil Abloh, who died from a rare type of cancer in November, designed a homeware collection exclusively for Ramadan.
