RIYADH: Investment in new production of metals, minerals, and other commodities has lagged, despite a surge in numerous commodities’ prices, Bloomberg reported, citing the head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs said. The separation between increasing prices and sluggish production is what Jeff Currie calls a “volatility trap” in which “higher volume discourages more investment, which then reinforces higher volume.” Currie explained that without policies to ease soaring prices and give further certainty about outlook, investors will be reluctant to sink money into new production [such as mining] for the next potential years. “You’ve got to grow supply and de-bottleneck the system, so that you can accommodate more demand growth on a forward-going basis,” Currie told Bloomberg. “That's how you ended the 70s. It's how you ended the 2000s. And that's how we're going to end this one,” he added.
