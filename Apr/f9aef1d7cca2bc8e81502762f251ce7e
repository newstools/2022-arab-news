DUBAI: MBC Studios, the in-house premium content production arm of MBC Group, has announced the production of the upcoming title “Rose & Layla.” The Arabic-language series will bring together Egyptian icons Yousra and Nelly Karim for the first time. It is penned by British screenwriter Cris Cole (“Mad Dogs,” “Ana,” “Pelican Blood”) and directed by British film and television director Adrian Shergold (“Mad Dogs,” “Cordelia,” “One Way to Denmark”). Produced by Maged Mohsen and Safa Aburizik, “Rose & Layla” is the first series of its kind by MBC Studios, with international distribution to be managed by Till Entertainment. The action and dark comedy series follows the adventures of two financially challenged and comedically incompetent detectives as they find their way through one big mystery, crossing unlikely paths and encountering wild characters. Each episode will see Rose and Layla getting a few steps closer to uncovering the truth about a bank fraud in Cairo. Along the way, the duo is repeatedly set back by seemingly irrelevant cases they are hired to investigate, but which eventually tie back to the main mystery. “Rose & Layla” includes 10 50 to 60-minute episodes and will premiere on Shahid VIP in the final quarter of 2022.
