Jair Bolsonaro promised simple solutions to Brazil’s rising violent crime, falling living standards and widespread corruption, but what has emerged is Latin America’s most right-wing president since the military dictatorships of the 1970s. The so-called “Trump of the Tropics” has established a reputation based on his polemical, sensationalist statements. Written by a journalist with decades of experience in the field, “Beef, Bible and Bullets” is a compelling account of the origins of Brazil’s unique brand of right-wing populism, according to a review on goodreads.com. The author offers the first major assessment of the Bolsonaro government and the growing tensions between extremist and moderate conservatives.
