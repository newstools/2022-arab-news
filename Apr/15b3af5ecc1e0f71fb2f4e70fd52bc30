ABU DHABI: Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi is to host a duathlon and run on April 25 as part of Ramadan celebrations and the UAE city fitness communities’ TrainYas activities. This year’s DuYas will see athletes tackle the 27.5-kilometer endurance race featuring a 5-kilometer run, and a 20-kilometer cycle, before closing out the event with a 2.5-kilometer run to the finish line. Held on the Yas Marina Circuit track, athletes can compete as an individual or as a team, with prizes available for top finishers across the event. First-place finishers in the male, female, and teams categories will win a top prize of 2,500 Emirati dirhams ($680), with classes including junior, open, masters, and veteran sections. Participants will also be able to enter the family friendly RunYas event involving a 5-kilometer or 2.5-kilometer course for runners of all ages. To meet local safety requirements, entrants will need to present a 96-hour negative polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 and show their Al-Hosn green pass for entry. Unvaccinated participants will be required to produce a 48-hour negative PCR test for entry. Athletes can enter the DuYas event in either of two categories, through the sprint duathlon for individuals, or the sprint duathlon relay for teams, with entry fees starting from 150 dirhams for Monday’s event.
