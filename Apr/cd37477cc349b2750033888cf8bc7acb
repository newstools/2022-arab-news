CAIRO: Ghada Shalaby, Egypt’s deputy tourism minister, discussed with representatives from Finland and Estonia the possibility of increasing tourist inflows from those countries. Egypt’s tourism sector has been greatly affected by the Russia-Ukraine conflict as tourists from those two countries represented about 40 percent of beach tourism in Egypt, prompting the Arab state to search for new markets, particularly from Europe and Asia. Shalaby reviewed measures taken by Egypt to resume tourist inflows, such as facilitating entry by allowing 78 nationalities to obtain an emergency tourist visa upon arrival or electronically. She said Egyptian hotels are being re-evaluated according to new classification criteria to ensure the suitability of their classification for the service they provide.
