Bright pink in color and tangy in taste, pickled turnip is a staple side dish on dining tables in all Mediterranean countries such as Lebanon, Egypt, and Syria. Although turnips were once considered a food of the poor in European history, the root vegetable is a favorite among Arabs, especially when pickled. The pickling method dates back to around 7,000 B.C. and was used to help prevent food from rotting. It developed to become a way of making salty side dishes of various vegetables such as carrots, cauliflower, and cucumber, and sometimes it is made using lemons and peaches, or other fruits. Pickled turnip, or as Arabs call it torshi, is a simple recipe that can be made at home with humble ingredients. All that is required is a 450-gram turnip, one small beetroot for flavoring and coloring, two cups of water, two tablespoons of salt, two teaspoons of sugar, and a jar or container. Start by peeling and cutting the turnip and beetroot into two-centimeter-wide sticks without trimming down the length. Boil the water in a pot, add the salt and sugar, and stir until they dissolve. Put the turnip and beetroot in the jar or container and add the water after letting it cool to room temperature. Pepper or vinegar can be added to give an extra kick. Leave it in the fridge for at least a week before serving. Once the pickle bottle has been opened, its contents should be consumed within two months.
