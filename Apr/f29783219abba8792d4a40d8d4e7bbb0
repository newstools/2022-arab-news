BEIRUT: Lebanese President Michel Aoun has met Lebanon’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Fawzi Kabbara, before he returns to Riyadh, Aoun said in a tweet on Tuesday.
Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry announced that the kingdom’s ambassador to Beirut had returned to Lebanon on April 7, in a sign of easing tensions following a rift that saw the kingdom and other Gulf states withdraw their envoys last year.
