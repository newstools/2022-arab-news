For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle Romanian-Jordanian Muaddi call the allegations that she had any involvement with the rapper an “unfounded lie.” The designer, who collaborated with both Rihanna and ASAP Rocky on footwear collections, wrote: “I’ve always believed that an unfounded lie spread on social media doesn’t deserve any response or clarification, especially one that is so vile. I initially assumed that this fake gossip — fabricated with such malicious intent — would not be taken seriously.   “However, in the last 24 hours I’ve been reminded that we live in a society that is so quick to speak on topics regardless of factual basis and that nothing is off limits. Not even during what should be one of the most beautiful and celebrated times in one’s life.” Rihanna, who announced her pregnancy in January, is expecting her first child with Rocky. “Therefore I have to speak up as this is not only directed towards me but it is related to people I have a great amount of respect and affection for,” Muaddi’s statement continued. “While Rih is continuing to live her serene, best dressed pregnancy life and I go back to my business — I wish everyone a beautiful Easter weekend!”   The singer-turned-entrepreneur is one of Muaddi’s most loyal fans. She has an unparalleled collection of heels by the designer, which have become her go-to choice of footwear whether she is attending lavish red-carpet events, fundraising galas, taking an off-duty stroll or stepping out to dinner. Recently, she has been rocking Muaddi’s creations as part of her head-turning maternity style. The designer’s last post before the rumors broke out was of Rihanna championing her Ursina pumps.
