AMMAN: With hot weather prevailing since almost the first day of Ramadan, many Jordanians have started a simple yet healthy beverage business by selling freshly squeezed orange juice. Using simple hand blenders, several Jordanians, including women, are selling fresh orange juice and other fruit drinks at cheap prices, with many consumers rushing to get their fill. From a small van she drives herself, Um Yousef sells fresh orange juice at a particularly busy intersection in Amman’s neighborhood of Tlaa al-Ali. “It’s very fresh and healthy,” Um Yousef, a mother of four, said while squeezing oranges with a hand blender. Like many other Jordanians, Um Yousef’s juice stand secures her a “good income” that helps her provide for her children. “At least this kind of juice is very healthy with zero sugar or additions … customers can see its production with their eyes. It’s very simple: Fresh oranges, hand blender and a bottle,” she told Arab News. Um Yousef said that she opens her stand just two hours before iftar when it’s not too hot so that her customers can enjoy fresh orange juice with their feasts. “I keep the orange juice bottles in iceboxes.” Schoolboy Abdullah Daana also sells fresh orange juice at an intersection in Amman. Daana, a 10th grader, said that he and his brother make decent money from the orange juice they sell, helping to cover their school and university studies. Asked whether health authorities require them to abide by certain rules, Abdullah said municipality inspectors sometimes show up to check on their mobile orange stand but “always leave with no notes.” Daana said that some customers prefer to have the orange juice put into glass bottles they bring with them.
