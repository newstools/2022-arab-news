RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Citizen Account Program on Sunday deposited SR1.8 billion ($480 million) into the accounts of 10.3 million beneficiaries for April.
Total compensation for the previous instalment, paid retroactively, stood at SR25 million.
The national scheme was created to protect Saudi households from the direct, indirect and expected impacts of the economic reforms taking place in the Kingdom through monthly cash transfers into their accounts.
The cash transfer program has distributed SR116 billion in payments since it was launched in December 2017.
The program’s director general of communications, Abdullah Al-Hajri, said that 76 percent of beneficiaries received full benefits, with an average support of SR1,065 per household.
The cost-of-living supplements for Saudi citizens are based on age, household monthly income and the number of people living in a property.
