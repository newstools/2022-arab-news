CAIRO: An Arab delegation held talks in Warsaw with Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau before meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba. The meetings focused on efforts to reach a peaceful solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The delegation asked Rau to facilitate the transit of Arabs leaving Ukraine for Poland, and discussed Arab-Polish relations. According to an Arab League statement, the delegation stressed the “necessity of a ceasefire and an end to the crisis on the basis of international law, the Charter of the United Nations, the principles of good neighbourliness, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.” The delegation — which included Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit and the foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Algeria and Sudan — arrived in Warsaw from Moscow, where they met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Algerian Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra said: “A political solution is possible.” During a press conference with Kuleba, Lamamra added that the delegation “has become more aware of the development of the situation in the Ukrainian crisis and the existing concerns after its meeting with the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine.” He stressed the delegation’s “deep concern about this crisis, its repercussions at all levels, especially its humanitarian consequences, and the threats it poses to global peace and security.” Lamamara said: “The Arabs cannot be indifferent to a major crisis facing two countries with which they have very close and friendly relations based on mutual respect and cooperation.” He added: “We are here because we firmly believe in the virtues of diplomacy and dialogue to reach peaceful and political solutions to problems, no matter how difficult or complex they are.”
