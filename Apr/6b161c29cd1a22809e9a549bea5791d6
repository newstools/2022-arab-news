Egypt’s Al-Ahly and Algeria’s ES Setif are set for an all-Arab semi-final in the African Champions League after negotiating difficult second legs in the quarterfinals on Friday night. Reigning champions Al-Ahly managed a 1-1 draw against Raja Casablanca of Morocco after winning an ill-tempered and controversial first leg 2-1 in Cairo. Fabrice Ngoma gave Raja the lead after only five minutes but Al-Ahly equalized on the night through defender Mohamed Abdelmonem just before half-time for 3-2 aggregate win. The Egyptian giants hold the record for most wins in the competition with 10 titles, and will now be eying third win in a row. Meanwhile ES Setif, champions in 2014, defeated their hosts Esperance of Tunisia 1-0 after a goalless match in the fits leg. Abdelmoumene Djabou scored the only goal of the match for ES Setif in the 21st minute.
