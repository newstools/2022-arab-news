JEDDAH: The government has launched a new interactive online platform to aid the development of the nation’s cultural sector and engage with those who work in it. The “Cultural Policies Design Lab” was announced by the Ministry of Culture on Wednesday and will initially provide a forum for the sharing of ideas and proposals related to the film industry. The aim of the lab is to ensure the Kingdom keeps pace with local and global cultural movements by providing a platform for tackling challenges and contributing to the achievement of its goals. The scheme is open to both individuals and organizations, and anyone wishing to get involved can do so at https://engage.moc.gov.sa/cpl. The ministry said it was initially interested in hearing from experts and practitioners in the film sector but added that the platform would be rolled out to other disciplines in the future. It is hoped the design lab will stimulate the Kingdom’s cultural sector by presenting innovative ideas, identifying challenges and opportunities and creating an attractive environment for industry and investment.
