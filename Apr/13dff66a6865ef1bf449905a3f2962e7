LONDON: Medical teams from the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSrelief) continue to provide assistance to Syrian refugees in Jordan, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported. The clinicians from the humanitarian organization have treated 582 patients with various health conditions in the Zaatari camp in Jordan for people fleeing the conflict in Syria. The KSrelief laboratory team examined a further 72 people and provided tailored medication for more than 420 patients. The work being carried out by KSrelief comes after Abdullah Al-Rabeeah, the general supervisor of the organization toured the Zaatari camp last month. Al-Rabeeah was accompanied by Nayef Al-Sudairi, the Saudi ambassador to Jordan, and senior officials and volunteers from KSrelief, who reviewed the progress that has been made by humanitarian projects launched by the center to improve the lives of residents.
