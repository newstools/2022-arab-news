JEDDAH: The Saudi Heritage Commission has identified 253 significant new sites in Asir and Hail provinces, adding to its growing National Antiquities Register that aims to record the country’s history. Dr. Jasir Al-Herbish, CEO of the commission, said there are 141 sites in Asir and 112 in Hail. Al-Herbish said the sites include a large number of inscriptions, drawings, and old rock markings dating back to prehistoric times, as well as some Islamic inscriptions and writing. He said the commission has made significant progress in documenting the Kingdom’s historical and archaeological sites, which includes digitizing and archiving this information. He urged citizens to report any finds through the commission’s “Balagh” platform, or its social media accounts. The country’s people are important partners in preserving the country’s heritage, he said. The commission is tasked with this responsibility under the second paragraph of Article 8 of the Law of Antiquities, Museums and Urban Heritage, which states that “the commission prepares registration lists for archaeological sites.” Under the Ministry of Culture, the commission has established a nationwide conservation strategy covering four categories: Antiquities, urban heritage, handicrafts and intangible cultural heritage. Under the patronage of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the World Heritage Center, the International Council on Monuments and Sites has marked April 18 of every year as Heritage Day, which is celebrated globally, including in Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom took part in the Heritage Day festivities in 2021, as part of its campaign to highlight the importance of this work.
