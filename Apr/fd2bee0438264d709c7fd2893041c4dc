MAKKAH: The General Presidency for the Affairs of the Two Holy Mosques has allocated smart guidance robots for fatwa issuance at the Grand Mosque in Makkah.
The robots will operate in several sites, including women’s praying sections, providing information, clarity on rituals performance, and remote communication with scholars, along with the option of adding live interpretation and translation in multiple languages.
Equipped with a 21-inch touch screen, each robot will offer services in Arabic, English, French, Russian, Persian, Turkish, Malay, Urdu, Chinese, Bengali, and Hausa.
The wheeled robots house high-resolution cameras, high-definition headphones, a microphone, and high-speed Wi-Fi to enable fast data transmission.
Separately, the free trial phase of the Makkah Bus Project, which included the recently launched routes (6, 7A, 12 and 7), has been a success.
The project’s team worked from the Unified Center for Transport in Makkah to conduct technical tests and match them with the high standards of the program’s requirements. This has resulted in a success that met the project’s aims, while the service has been appreciated by Makkah’s residents and visitors.
