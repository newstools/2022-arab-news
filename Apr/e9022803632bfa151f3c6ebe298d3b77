DUBAI: The UAE summoned Sweden’s ambassador to the country, Liselott Andersson, to protest against the burning of copies of the Qur’an by extremists in the Nordic country, Emirates News Agency reported on Tuesday. Minister of State for International Cooperation Reem Al-Hashimy affirmed the UAE's rejection of all practices that offend religions, and stressed the need to respect religious symbols and avoid incitement and polarisation. The minister underscored that such practices only lead to more tension and confrontation at a time when the world needs to work together to spread the values ​​of tolerance and coexistence and reject hatred and extremism. Sweden, a nation of 10 million, has seen unrest, scuffles, arson and violence since Thursday that has left some police officers and protesters injured. It was triggered by Danish far-right politician Rasmus Paludan’s meetings and planned Qur’an burnings across the country.
