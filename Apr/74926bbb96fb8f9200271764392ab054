I have personally used Fanni on a number of occasions, as I am in the process of renovating my bedroom and recently requested a carpenter to assemble my 3-door sliding wardrobe. Prior to that, my family and I had a rooftop party for my little sister’s birthday and I requested an air conditioning expert to fix the leakage that was coming out on the roof wall days before the party. The handymen from Fanni are genuine hard workers that provide their services in an excellent, professional and honest manner. I am very satisfied with Fanni’s high-quality service and will request a painter and a floor tiling installer to give my kitchen a total makeover. Fanni was established in 2016 with the concept of sharing economy in mind; enjoy high-quality service at affordable prices.
