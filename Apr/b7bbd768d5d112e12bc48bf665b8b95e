RIYADH: The Houthi militia in Yemen announced the release of the crew of an Emirati vessel called Rwabee, the group’s spokesman said on Monday.
Yemen’s Houthis say the Emirati cargo vessel that they seized in the Red Sea in January had been carrying military hardware, but the Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen says the ship had been carrying medical equipment.
