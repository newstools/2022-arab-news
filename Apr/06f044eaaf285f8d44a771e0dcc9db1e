WASHINGTON D.C.: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday encouraged Yemen’s new leader to work toward a lasting peace amid rare bright spots after seven years of devastating war. Blinken spoke by telephone with Rashad Al-Alimi, who heads a new council running the government after the former president handed over power. Blinken voiced support for a UN-brokered two-month truce between the government and Iranian-backed Houthi militia that has largely held since April 2, the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The top US diplomat “underscored the need to seize the momentum from these positive developments to secure a lasting cease-fire and a comprehensive peace process,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said. He also called for progress on reopening roads to areas including Taiz, Yemen’s third largest city, another key part of the truce brokered under UN special envoy Hans Grundberg.
