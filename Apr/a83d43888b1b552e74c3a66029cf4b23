Chief Technology and Sustainability Officer of SABIC Bob Maughon told Arab News the company is keen “to highlight the importance of filing intellectual property, and trademarks of protecting innovation, of protecting and enabling growth, and also ensuring that you do it in a way that's strategic and brings value for the long term.”  In SABIC’s 2021 annual report, it reported 10,090 patents and pending applications, as well as 20 technology and innovation centers. The report also stated that SABIC’s sales increased by 50 percent, reaching $46.64 billion, compared to $31.19 billion in 2020. The rise came despite a 3 percent drop in sales volume.
