RIYADH: The Masam project launched by Saudi Arabia has saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis by clearing land mines laid by Houthi militia throughout the country.
Mines and other explosive devices have killed or severely injured thousands of children, women and elderly in Yemen in recent years.
According to human rights groups, Houthi fighters have laid land mines randomly in Yemeni residential areas, as well as around roads, schools and farms, in clear violation of international laws.
Despite the danger, 32 Masam teams have cleared more than 329,000 mines in several Yemeni regions since the project was launched in 2018.
Teams are helped by more than 450 experts and rely on the latest technology to explosive devices.
The Masam project has been extended for a fourth consecutive year in an effort to protect lives and strengthen security across Yemen.
