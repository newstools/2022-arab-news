Looking for the newest cafe to hang out with friends or enjoy a quick coffee while studying? Sociale Cafe is a great place to consider. The cafe opened in mid-November and has already become a popular social hub for friends in Riyadh.
The cafe’s detailed, health-conscious menu and relaxing and eclectic atmosphere have quickly attracted the attention of visitors across social media platforms, with many videos going viral on TikTok and Instagram.
Located in the busy downtown Riyadh Tahlia Street, visitors will usually have a difficult time finding an empty seat, but the wait is definitely worth it.
Sociale Cafe offers a variety of healthy and shareable dishes and snacks including avocado toast, spinach dip, whole roasted cauliflower and many more.
The best dessert to try is the milk cake which offers a lightly sweet and creamy snack for visitors to enjoy alongside their lattes. The cafe is also the perfect location for studying or holding casual meetings with groups of people, with its spacious large tables. Wi-fi is provided for free.
The baristas and staff are extremely welcoming and make guests feel at home. Sociale Cafe also provides a game corner filled with board games to play with friends while enjoying your coffee.
During the month of Ramadan, the cafe will be open from 5:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. and also offers private iftar and sahoor reservations.
One thing to keep in mind is how busy the cafe becomes on weekends. We recommend visiting during the week to fully enjoy the tranquillity of the cafe.
