DUBAI: Supercar maker Lamborghini delivered 2,539 vehicles worldwide in the first quarter of 2022, a 5 percent increase over the same period in 2021, and a 31 percent rise over the same period in 2020, making Q1 the best-ever quarter for the company. There was positive growth in almost all markets in the first quarter, with Europe, the Middle East, and Africa seeing 40 percent growth. America and the Asia Pacific regions recorded 32 percent and 28 percent growth respectively. Despite such an impressive record, Russia did not witness growth, due to the company’s suspension of business operations in the country. Worldwide deliveries of Urus and Huracán reached 1,547 and 844 units, respectively, as compared to the first quarter of 2021. Stephan Winkelmann, chairman and CEO of Automobili Lamborghini, said: “Despite the uncertainty caused by a geopolitical situation that is not only deeply distressing but also means it is hard to make forecasts of any kind, we can count on exceptional appeal worldwide right now.” Lamborghini currently has enough orders to cover more than 12 months of production, Winkelmann said. Results for Q1 followed a record year for 2021 in terms of sales, which reached 8,405 units and profitability of 20.2 percent.
