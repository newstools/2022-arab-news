JEDDAH: The King Abdulaziz and His Companions Foundation for Giftedness and Creativity, also known as Mawhiba, has won a gold medal at the Middle East and North Africa Stevie Awards for its response to COVID-19. This category honors institutions and companies that dealt positively and effectively with the pandemic through their community outreach services. Mawhiba Secretary-General Saud Al-Mathami thanked King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for their support, which he said allowed the organization to identify and develop the skills of talented people across the globe. Al-Mathami said the generous support from the Saudi leadership resulted in Mawhiba being able to act as a beacon for those seeing excellence, particularly in its use of technology. Mawhiba provides programs to develop the skills of talented youth in culture, science, and education. During the pandemic, the organization had continued its digital transformation to support the needs of students and participants. In 2020, the institution provided services to over 10,000 students, and more than 11,000 in 2021. Mawhiba has also organized training programs for 5,000 educators as part of its professional development program, so that they can teach the courses offered by the organization. Part of the organization’s achievements during the pandemic was its participation in several international scientific competitions. Al-Mathami said its students won 57 medals in 2020 and 52 medals in 2021, while also winning 96 prizes in the National Olympiad for Scientific Creativity last year, and eight international awards in the International Science and Engineering Fair. The Stevie Awards was created in 2002 to honor the achievements of organizations and professionals globally.  The winners of the Middle East and North Africa region were rated by more than 110 professionals worldwide, serving on six juries.
