PARIS: France’s former president Nicolas Sarkozy said on Tuesday he would vote for centrist Emmanuel Macron in a run-off presidential vote against far-right leader Marine Le Pen.
“I will vote for Emmanuel Macron because I believe he has the necessary experience faced with a grave international crisis ..., his economic project puts the value of work as the top priority and his commitment to Europe is clear and unambiguous,” Sarkozy posted on his Facebook page ahead of the April 24 run-off vote.
