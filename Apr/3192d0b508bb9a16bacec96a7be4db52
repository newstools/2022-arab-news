LONDON: Liverpool striker Sadio Mane has described how the club has supported its Muslim players throughout Ramadan. Mane, a Muslim, said fasting during the holy month is difficult to manage as a player due to training times and the variety of kick-off times. Premier League footballers often play midweek evening matches and a range of afternoon kick-offs on the weekend. But ahead of this year’s holy month, Mane said the captain spoke to Manager Jurgen Klopp to request a change in training times to accommodate the club’s Muslim players. “Playing and training and doing Ramadan isn’t easy at all,” Mane told beIN Sports. “But before Ramadan we tried to talk to the captain and to tell the boss, maybe can we change the schedule? “We train in the morning. It’s easier for us. If you train in the morning then you have time to rest and go home … If you train around 2 p.m. or 3 p.m. it’s going to be tough. They said yes and I think that made it easier. We are trying to do our best.” He added: “Game day is something else but with Ramadan it’s tough. Liverpool tried to make everything easier for us. We spoke with our nutritionist, especially before the game. She did everything easier for us.”
