Al-Seih: The city of Al-Seih is hosting a vast 500 meter-long Ramadan iftar table – which boasts to be one of Saudi Arabia’s longest - on Wednesday. The table has been organized by Al Kharj Municipality in collaboration with several volunteers and private sector companies. But although it’s big – there’s no denying that – and while many Muslims will break their fast at it, the table will not break any records. However a special Ramadan program has been put together by organizers for attendees. It will include a children’s theater and a community program titled “Ramadan in the Past”. In addition, competitions for kids will be held over a five-day period in the King Abdulaziz Park in the Sulaymaniyah district located in Al-Seih city.
