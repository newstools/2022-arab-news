RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Supreme Court announced on Saturday that Sunday would be the last day of Ramadan, meaning Eid Al-Fitr would begin on Monday May 2.
The Crescent Sighting Committee of the Supreme Court held a session to determine the start of the month of Shawwal for this year, which is done by the sighting of the crescent moon, in accordance with the Muslim lunar calendar.
The committee said it had not seen any evidence of the moon on Saturday evening, Saudi Press Agency said, citing a royal court statement.
“The department decided that Sunday...is the 30th day of the blessed month of Ramadan for this year, and that Monday...is the first day of the blessed Eid Al-Fitr day for this year,” the statement said.
The Supreme Court congratulated King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, all Saudi citizens, residents, and Muslims, on Eid Al-Fitr.
