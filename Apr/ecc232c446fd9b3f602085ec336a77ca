RIYADH: The Saudi Green Initiative is developing creative solutions to tackle climate change, besides consulting the Kingdom in evolving into an international leader in sustainability.
The forum’s three primary goals are to cut carbon emissions by 278 million tons per year till 2030, plant 10 million trees across the country, and safeguard 30 percent of land and sea.
The first wave of more than 60 programs planned under the SGI represents a total investment of over SR700 billion ($187 billion) to flourish the green economy.
By lowering carbon emissions, afforestation of places in Saudi Arabia, and conserving land and marine areas, the forum intends to build a sustainable future. The SGI collaborates with institutions and groups across the Kingdom to scale up existing climate programs and develop new ones. It also identifies the potential for collaboration and innovation between public and commercial sustainability activities.
Saudi Arabia is a critical player in global initiatives such as the Global Ocean Alliance, which aims to protect at least 30 percent of the world’s ocean in marine protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures by 2030.
The Kingdom is also keen on collaborating with the UN Sports for Climate Action Initiative and the Global Methane Pledge.
An energy leader for decades, the KSA is now positioning itself at the vanguard of environmental action. This effort is encapsulated in the SGI.
