LONDON: The half-brother of Jordan’s King Abdullah II relinquished his princely title on Sunday. In a letter posted on his Twitter account, Prince Hamzah said he gave up his title because his “personal convictions and the values” instilled in him by his father “are not in line with the approaches, trends and modern methods of our institutions.” He said that he was honored to have served his country and people by holding the title previously and would continue to be loyal to Jordan and serve the “country, people, and the message of (our) fathers and forefathers” in his private life as much as he could.
