RIYADH: More than 2,700 tons of dates have been handed over to representatives of the World Food Program (WFP) in the Yemeni city of Aden by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSrelief), Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported on Thursday. The dates will be distributed to 1,785,000 individuals in seven Yemeni governorates, as part of the Saudi government’s support for the people of Yemen. Acting Office Director of WFP in Aden, Mohammed Sheikh, praised the in-kind assistance offered from KSrelief for underprivileged people in Yemen, adding that the aid arrived just in time during the holy month of Ramadan, where food needs of households have increased. He said the distribution process was implemented according to an accurate mechanism that targets those who are in need. Since the start of Ramadan, KSrelief has embarked on distributing 5,000 tons of dates for 13 Yemeni governorates, targeting more than 600,000 needy families. This assistance is part of the annual Saudi contribution for several Arab and Islamic countries, including Yemen, through KSrelief, SPA added.
