CAIRO: Egypt will allow mosques to hold mass late night prayers during the last days of Ramadan, according to the ministry of endowments. The ministry has reversed a previous decision that was issued on April 15 banning the night prayers of Tahajud this year citing coronavirus concerns. The decision will allow the prayers to be performed at major mosques in Egypt only.
