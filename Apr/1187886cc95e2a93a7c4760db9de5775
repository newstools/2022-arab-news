Moscow is expelling 15 Dutch diplomats after the Netherlands last month told 18 Russian diplomats to leave, Russia’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday.
The ministry said in a separate statement that Russia was also expelling some Belgian diplomats in a retaliatory move.
European countries have kicked out more than 300 Russian embassy staff since Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. Russia has stepped up its response in the past week by expelling diplomats from the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and the European Union, as well as the Dutch and Belgians.
