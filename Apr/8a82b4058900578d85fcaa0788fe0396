RIYADH: Gold prices fell on Wednesday as the US dollar consolidated at its highest level in more than two years and pressured demand for greenback-priced bullion. Spot gold was down 0.4 percent at $1,897.86 per ounce, as of 0612 GMT. US gold futures slid 0.3 percent to $1,898.80. Silver gains, platinum dips Spot silver gained 0.2 percent to $23.53 per ounce. Platinum dipped 0.1 percent to $920.23, and palladium firmed 0.6 percent to $2,200.40. Wheat eases Chicago wheat ticked lower on Wednesday after climbing more than 2 percent in the previous session, although concerns over tightening world supplies limited the losses. Corn fell after two straight sessions of gains, while soybeans slipped for the fourth day. A decline in the US winter crop rating and delays in spring planting provided some support to prices. The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade fell 0.5 percent to $10.89-1/4 a bushel, as of 0405 GMT. Corn gave up 0.3 percent to $7.99 a bushel, while soybeans slid three-quarters of a cent to $16.71 a bushel. China iron ore, steel futures rebound Chinese iron ore and steel futures rose on Wednesday after falling for two consecutive days, as concerns stoked by the COVID-19 outbreak eased. Benchmark iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange had plunged more than 8 percent this week until Tuesday, while construction-used rebar on the Shanghai Futures Exchange lost some 3 percent on fears over sluggish demand outlook due to recurring COVID-19 outbreaks in China. The most-active iron ore contract for September delivery jumped as much as 3.5 percent to $127.19 a ton in the morning session. Spot prices of iron ore with 62 percent iron content for delivery to China rose 50 cents to $139.5 a ton on Tuesday, according to SteelHome consultancy. (With inputs from Reuters)
