RIYADH: The Philippines’ Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Dr. Adnan Alonto met recently with Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Health Fahad Al-Jalajel at his office in Riyadh to discuss several issues of common interest, and various ways to enhance health cooperation between the two countries. They talked about the possibility of further enhancing cooperation between the Philippines and the Kingdom in the medical profession including on research and development. Filipinos work across the Kingdom in the medical sector mostly as nurses. After the meeting, Alonto toured Seha Virtual Hospital, where he was briefed on its services. The Saudi Health Ministry launched the Kingdom’s first virtual hospital on Feb. 28 as part of ongoing efforts to digitize the healthcare sector. With a growing live network of 130 connected hospitals, SVH is the largest of its kind in the world. The only other virtual hospital to rival it is in the US, with 43 connected hospitals. Patients of SVH do not need to travel to different parts of the Kingdom to be seen by specialized physicians, nor are they limited by 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. clinical hours. Showcasing its expertise in the holy month of Ramadan, a specialist team from the facility saved the life of an elderly woman who suffered a stroke inside the Grand Mosque in Makkah while performing Umrah. The 62-year-old woman was transferred by local paramedics to an emergency center inside the Grand Mosque after feeling weak, experiencing flaccid facial muscles, and gradually losing consciousness. She was immediately transferred to the nearby Ajyad Emergency Hospital, where a CT scan was undertaken that confirmed the initial diagnosis. She was examined by the SVH’s neurologist and stroke consultants and then transferred to the nearby King Abdullah Medical City for treatment. Unlike simple video calls with doctors, the SVH allows patients to visit their local hospital and attend a real-time live video clinical session with top specialists from across the Kingdom.
