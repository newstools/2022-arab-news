MANILA: The Saudi Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawah and Guidance inaugurated two programs to distribute iftar meals and luxury dates in the Philippines. The programs were launched at an event at the Saudi Embassy in Manila within the framework of the Kingdom’s Ramadan programs that it implements every year in a number of countries. The two programs aim to distribute 3,500 food baskets to Muslim families in the Philippines, and five tons of dates, to be distributed throughout Ramadan in coordination with official charities. This year, Saudi Arabia launched iftar programs in 34 countries to provide iftar meals for Muslims throughout the holy month, which started on April 2, to benefit nearly 1.2 million people. The ministry has made all the necessary arrangements to reach all continents, depending on the need and requests, in coordination with Saudi embassies and the ministry’s Islamic centers. Meanwhile, the ministry has handed over a gift from King Salman to the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs in Gabon, comprising the publications of the King Fahd Complex for the Printing of the Holy Qur’an in Madinah. The gift was delivered by Saudi Ambassador to Gabon Abdurrahman bin Salem Al-Dahas during the reception ceremony at the embassy’s headquarters, in the presence of a number of Islamic authorities and embassy employees. The president of the Gabonese Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Imam Ismail Osini Osa, thanked the Saudi government for the valuable gift, the receipt of which coincided with the advent of Ramadan, stressing that it was appreciated by the Muslims of Gabon, and embodies the Kingdom’s care for the Holy Qur’an, the way of life for Muslims.
