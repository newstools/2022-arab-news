Al-Taawoun kicked off their 2022 AFC Champions League campaign with 2-1 win over Al-Duhail of Qatar at King Abdullah Sports City Stadium in Buraidah on Thursday night. The Saudi club’s first three points in Group D were secured thanks to Leandre Tawamba’s equalizer in the 11 minute and Alvaro Medran’s winner four minutes from time, overturning Edmilson’s eighth-minute opener for Al-Duhail. The result puts Al-Taawoun in second place in the group, behind Iranian club Sepahan on goal difference. It was Al-Duhail who struck first, with Brazilian forward Edmilson taking advantage of a mistake by goalkeeper Muataz Al-Bagawi and defender Rayan Al-Mousa. But the Qatari team’s advantage lasted just three minutes before the Cameroonian Tawamba levelled by chipping Zakaria Hassan in Al-Duhail’s goal. After the equalizer, Al-Taawoun’s momentum stalled, with Al-Duhail regaining control of the match and threatening Al-Bagawi’s goal on more than one occasion, but the first half ended without an addition to the scoreline. Al-Duhail started the second half in the ascendency and once again forced Al-Taawoun to defend deep and play on the counter. The Saudi team finally swung the tie their way thanks to the Spaniard Medran’s winner on 86 minutes. He collected a smart pass from Tawamba before finishing past Hassan to secure a vital 2-1 win. Al-Taawoun will next face Pakhtakor of Uzbekistan on Sunday, while Al-Duhail will meet Sepahan on the same day.
