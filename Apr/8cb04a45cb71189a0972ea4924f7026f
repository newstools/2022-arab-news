CAIRO: Egypt’s government is ready to provide all means of support and facilities necessary to host the new headquarters of the African Medicines Agency, said Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly. During a meeting with an African Union delegation, he indicated the importance that Egypt attaches to hosting the AMA headquarters, which was approved during the country’s presidency of the AU. Madbouly emphasized Egypt’s belief in the importance of the AMA as a regulatory framework for Africa’s pharmaceutical industries, and for the advancement of public health on the continent. He said Egypt has designated a diplomatic quarter in its new administrative capital to be the headquarters of diplomatic missions and the residence of their workers, and it could host the AMA headquarters. He added that the government has already begun a gradual move to the new administrative capital in preparation for its complete relocation. Madbouly called on the AU delegation to make a field visit to the new administrative capital to see the work carried out and to visit the diplomatic quarter there.
