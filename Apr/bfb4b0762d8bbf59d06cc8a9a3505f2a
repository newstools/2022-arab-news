CAIRO: Egypt has added India to its list of countries from which it imports wheat, Cairo has announced. El-Said Marzouq El-Qosair, Egypt’s minister of agriculture and land reclamation, said this comes within the framework of the state’s efforts to secure new sources of wheat. Egypt is the largest importer of wheat in the world and depends on Russia and Ukraine, which have been in conflict for nearly two months, raising concerns about supplies. An Egyptian delegation went to India to discuss wheat imports, visiting fields and grain stores in various regions. The two sides also discussed facilitating the flow of Egyptian agricultural exports to India.
