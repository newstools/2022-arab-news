DUBAI: A two-year-old boy in Saudi Arabia’s Khafji Governorate was seriously injured after a group of stray dogs viciously attacked him. Nine dogs attacked Saif Al-Yami in a stadium, leaving him with severe wounds all over his body, the child’s uncle Saleh Al-Yami told Al Arabiya. After the attack, the boy was taken to Khafji General Hospital but doctors did not have the adequate resources to treat his condition, according to his uncle. He was then transferred to Qatif Central Hospital, where he has since undergone surgery and is currently recovering. The boy’s family had contacted the Eastern Province Municipality eight months prior and submitted reports about several attacks by stray dogs in the neighborhood, the uncle told Al Arabiya, adding that they would continue to urge authorities to handle the dangers posed by these untamed animals.
