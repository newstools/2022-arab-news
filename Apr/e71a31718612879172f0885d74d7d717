RIYADH: Over SR1.84 billion ($492.95 million) has been donated to the National Platform for Charitable Work (Ehsan) since its Ramadan campaign was launched earlier this month, the Saudi Press Agency reported. More than 4.63 million people have so far benefited from the campaign, which was launched by the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority. The campaign is an extension of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's interest in supporting and developing the charity sector by making every effort to organize it, enable its activities, and sponsor it to raise its contribution to the development of society. This focus and support have had a significant impact on Ehsan in its efficiency and credibility in delivering donations to those most deserving of them. The Ehsan platform welcomes donations from individuals, companies, institutions, donors, and the financially privileged through its website and app https://ehsan.sa. There have been over 24 million donation transactions to date for the current campaign.
