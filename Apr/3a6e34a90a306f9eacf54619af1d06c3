Led by a curator-in-chief, who will be announced next month, the collective includes makeup artists Isamaya Ffrench and Erin Parsons, board-certified dermatologist Michelle Henry and more. Beauty Global Collective users can explore and buy experts’ favorite products through personal edits, as well as share beauty tips and advice with others. Meanwhile a free community app uses a points system, which allows users to build credit toward exclusive discounts and sales. The launch of Farfetch Beauty coincides with the wider Farfetch groups existing cosmetic offerings of Browns, Off-White and Violet Grey.
