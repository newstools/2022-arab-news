DUBAI: US multinational e-commerce company Amazon announced this week its partnership with two young Saudi artists, Alaa Al-Bukhari and Majd Jaha, to launch artworks designed for its electronic Eid gift cards collection. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle The designs offer a modern twist on Eidiyah, the popular gift-giving tradition between family and friends during the festive week. The artworks include graphics inspired by the Kingdom’s history and architecture to express the joy of Eid.   The gift cards give shoppers the chance to choose what they want or need from a selection of local and international products across categories such as jewelry, fashion, electronics and more. Al-Bukhari’s designs for Amazon were inspired by Saudi identity and history. The illustrator, who studied fine arts and graphic design, said in a released statement: “I feel very proud of this collaboration, and I would like to thank Amazon for giving me the opportunity to represent my work on this special occasion that brings happiness to many people.”   “I hope that my designs will help inspire emerging artists not only in Saudi Arabia, but all over the world,” she added. For Saudi painter Jaha, this is not the first time she works with Amazon. She designed the cards for the company last year.   For this year’s designs, Jaha combined elements of Saudi architecture and fashion from different regions, while including features that represent the joy of Eid and its traditions. Jaha showed a passion for drawing from an early age, launching the Majd Studio for Designs and Arts in 2018 to enrich Arab artistic content. “My first participation in designing electronic Eidiyah gift cards on Amazon had a great impact on the spread of my artwork around the Kingdom,” said Jaha. “We are continuing this cooperation with a passion to spread happiness to Amazon customers on one of the most important occasions.”
