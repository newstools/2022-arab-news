JEDDAH: The second edition of Jeddah Season is set to begin in early May, the National Events Center has said. It follows the success of Riyadh Season, which recorded more than 15 million visits over five months. After a two-year hiatus due to COVID-19 restrictions, Jeddah Season will take place this year, with the NEC set to reveal detailed information about the activities on offer at a press conference on April 9. The first Jeddah Season was held in the coastal city in 2019, recording more than 15 million visitors from the Kingdom and beyond. However, the 2020 and 2021 editions were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic as part of precautionary measures taken by Saudi authorities. This year’s Jeddah Season comes with a new identity that expresses the city’s cultural, historical, recreational and touristic diversity, providing options for residents and visitors of all ages. The events and activities of the season will emphasize Jeddah as a regional tourist destination. Under the slogan “Our lovely days,” the 2022 Jeddah Season aims to promote cultural diversity, entertainment and openness to the world. Additionally, the program takes inspiration from the city’s coastal identity. The NEC seeks to achieve the development and economic goals of Saudi Vision 2030 by improving the events sector in the entertainment, sport, tourism and cultural fields. It also seeks to host attractive events that add to the Kingdom’s prosperous economy and society. Jeddah Season is part of a national strategic initiative, Saudi Seasons, which was not only launched to enrich the lives of people in the Kingdom, citizens and expats alike, but also to introduce the country as an important world tourist destination. The Saudi Seasons initiative also aims to highlight culture, entertainment and sports in the Kingdom.
