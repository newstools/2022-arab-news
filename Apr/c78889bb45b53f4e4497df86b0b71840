CAIRO: Egypt’s Foreign Ministry has condemned Israeli forces’ storming of Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque and violence against Palestinians in its courtyards, which resulted in dozens of injuries and arrests. Ministry spokesman Ahmed Hafez stressed the “necessity of self-restraint, providing full protection for Muslim worshippers and allowing them to perform Islamic rituals in Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is an Islamic endowment purely for Muslims.” He reaffirmed “the rejection of violence and incitement in all its forms, including calls for storming Al-Aqsa Mosque during the month of Ramadan,” which will affect “stability and security in the Palestinian territories and the region.”
