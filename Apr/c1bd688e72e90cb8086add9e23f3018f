Riyadh has been confirmed as host of the 2023 World Combat Games after a formal agreement was signed on Sunday between Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal, president of the Saudi Olympic and Paralympic Committee, and Ivo Ferriani, president of the Global Association of International Sports Federations. The news that the event will be held in Saudi Arabia first broke last May, and now the announcement has rubber-stamped the event. Prince Abdulaziz revealed that this tournament will be the latest in a growing series of international sporting events that are held under the banner of Saudi Vision 2030, which will promote a healthier and more active lifestyle across the Kingdom. He added that Saudi Arabia already has the infrastructure to organize this event, which will include 15 martial arts games. “We are all very happy to host so many world champions at these games,” he added.
