LONDON: Former British world champion boxer Amir Khan has scrapped plans to move to London with his family following an armed robbery while out with his wife in the capital on Monday. Two masked assailants stopped Khan and his wife Faryal Makhdoom outside a restaurant, pointing a gun in his face and demanding he hand over a £72,000 ($94,000) diamond-encrusted Franck Muller Vanguard watch. Makhdoom posted an Instagram video purportedly showing the suspects. Khan told MailOnline: “My plan was to move to London later this year with Faryal and the kids but after what happened there’s no chance that we’ll be doing that. Our plan to move there is not happening. We’re going to stick with living in Bolton and spending time in Dubai.” He subsequently flew off to Dubai with his wife to join their three children, with the boxer saying: “I just want to hug my kids and spend some time with them in the sun.” Makhdoom said: “To the selfish guys who pointed a gun at my husband’s head and risked everything, risked our lives all for a fricking watch, I say to you: Shame on you. How dare you pull that stunt on two parents all for a watch.”
