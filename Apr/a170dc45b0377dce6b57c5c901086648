Saudis are well-known for having a sweet tooth, and their willingness to sample confectionary from around the world has sparked a rise in different brands of ice creams, chocolates and desserts.
Bringing the taste of Italian dessert to Saudi Arabia has served up sweet success for Happiness Lab.
With a slogan of “happiness comes in colors and cones,” the lab is offering a wide range of gelato in Qatif.
Gelato contains 6 to 10 percent butterfat, 70 percent less air, and more flavoring than other kinds of frozen desserts.
“We learned how to make it in Italy and brought it to our home. We manufacture the gelato from beginning to end. It is natural, delicious, and fresh-made on daily basis,” said Mustafa Alzayer, the co-owner of Happiness Lab.
The gelato shop will take you through a tasty experience, offering customers the full richness of Italian desserts. Visitors to the lab will quickly feel the need to try different flavor combinations from all over Italy.
“It is healthy and delicious because we manufacture it without processed food and fat,” says Alzayer.
Alzayer said the lab boasts “fresh hazelnut, pistachio, dates, strawberry, mix berry, oreo, vanilla, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, mango, passion fruit, peach and more.”
Happiness Lab also offers a special waffle with gelato, which brings you joy with a fresh taste. For more information, visit their Instagram @happiness_lab_sa.
