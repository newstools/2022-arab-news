DUBAI: Renowned French jewelry brand Messika has launched its first-ever Ramadan campaign titled “Lailat Messika,” in collaboration with six well-known creatives from the Arabian peninsula.

The Ramadan campaign is based on these forged relationships.   The “Lailat Messika” campaign was lensed by award-winning Emirati director Abdulla Al-Kaabi and Tunisian photographer Moez Achour. The campaign video stars Saudi actress Mila Al-Zahrani, Emirati singer Almas, Bahrani journalist Nada Al-Shaibani, Saudi chef Sama Jaad, Qatari artist Alftoon Al-Janahi and Kuwaiti actress Eman Al-Hussaini, who all sit around a table enjoying each other’s company during sahoor (and decked out in Messika jewels, naturally).

I had the pleasure of spending it with inspiring women who are paving the way for future generations, each of whom embodies the spirit of our Maison in their own way. Freedom, sharing, passion, not to mention the spirit of entrepreneurship — these are all values that I felt by their side,” said the designer.   Each of the guests were wearing iconic pieces from Messika, including necklaces, rings, head pieces and hand chains.
