Crypto expert lands in jail for helping North Korea A New York judge sentenced a cryptocurrency expert to 63 months in prison for advising North Korea on how to circumvent US sanctions on its nuclear program using cryptocurrency services and blockchain technologies. To reduce the sentence for a crime that can carry up to 20 years in jail, Griffith, 39, pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate US law. Prosecutor Damian Williams said, “There is no question North Korea poses a national security threat to our nation. The regime has shown that it will stop at nothing to ignore our laws for its benefit.” “Griffith had admitted that he took actions to evade sanctions, which are in place to prevent (North Korea) from building a nuclear weapon,” the prosecutor said.
