Abdullah Alahmari was recently appointed CEO of International Maritime Industries, a fully integrated maritime facility and the largest shipyard in the Middle East and North Africa region.
His role includes setting strategic direction and facilitating business growth to position the company as a global leader in the maritime industry, offering its customers the combined operational expertise of its four JV partners including Saudi Aramco, Bahri, Lamprell, and Hyundai Heavy Industries.
With nearly 30 years’ experience in IT, systems, supply chain management, chemicals, oil and gas, and health services, Alahmari has a broad range of expertise leading high-performing teams.
Before joining the shipyard in 2018, Alahmari spent more than 18 years in a variety of leadership positions, including serving as vice president of business and services at Sadara Chemical for more than three years, where he helped lead a critical transition from commissioning and startup to full operation.
In 2015, he served as deputy minister at the Saudi Ministry of Health for around three years, where he was responsible for supply chain management and the operations of all the ministry’s medical facilities.
Prior to that, he held a leading role at Saudi Aramco for around seven years, where he spent the second half of his tenure stationed in Houston, Texas, executing the development and construction of Saudi Aramco research centers across North America.
Alahmari served as a board member at the Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization for two years and chairman of the board for Saudi Butanol Co. for three years.
