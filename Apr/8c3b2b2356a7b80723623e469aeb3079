I decided to stay there because I really learned to appreciate what it is to go, do my work, and then leave and live a normal life. “It took me moving there to really appreciate the time that I take for myself, instead of just going, going, going, and learning to say ‘no,’ and really putting myself first, and choosing the things that I want to do, wisely, for me first,” she added.
