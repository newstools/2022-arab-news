Sliders refer to miniature burgers that are a part of almost every burger joint these days. The term originated in the 1940s because this was how the US Navy described them, as being so small and extremely greasy they would slide down the throat. An American fast-food chain restaurant created the first sliders, which are now popular worldwide. It was around 2007 that these mini-burgers slid their way into the culinary world. They were seen to have infinite potential and are now a part of some of the most modern and state-of-the-art menus, with chefs constantly experimenting with them. This recipe provides a twist on the traditional sliders and is surprisingly easy to make: Take minced beef as required, shape the patties into small disks and season them with salt and pepper. Once a grill is heated, cook the small patties a few minutes on either side. While the patties are still hot, add slices of cheddar cheese and allow them to melt onto the meat. Toast the buns for a subtle crunch. The preparation of the patties can take place simultaneously with the grilling of some mushrooms. Once done add the patty to a bun with lettuce, sliced tomatoes, blue cheese, and a sauce of your choice.
