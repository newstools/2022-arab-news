DUBAI: The UAE will allow unvaccinated citizens to travel overseas from April 19, the government’s National Crisis and Emergency Management Authority (NCEMA) announced. However, unvaccinated Emiratis are required to present a negative PCR test result taken 48 hours before their departure and must complete travel application forms on the Al Hosn app to change their status to green. “The new protocol is in line with the UAE’s policy aimed at achieving sustainable recovery and the return to normalcy,” Dr. Taher Al-Ameri, NCEMA spokesman, said in a report from state news agency WAM. Dr. Al-Ameri also noted that unvaccinated individuals below 16 years old are exempted from presenting a negative PCR test result upon arrival, but must observe COVID-19 preventive measures. Coronavirus infections in the UAE are now considerably lower, thanks to aggressive testing and vaccination measures, with 237 new daily cases reported on Wednesday and no deaths. The total number of doses provided is now at 24,621,636, for a vaccine distribution rate of 248.94 doses per 100 people. Despite the UAE entering a recovery phase, the government urges continued adherence to precautionary measures including the wearing of face masks, social distancing, sanitizing of hands and avoidance of crowded areas, Dr. Al-Ameri said.
