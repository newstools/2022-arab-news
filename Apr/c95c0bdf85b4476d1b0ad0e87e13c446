RIYADH: With the beginning of the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, thousands of fasting people lined up in opposite rows in front of the iftar tables in the Grand Mosque and its courtyards waiting for the call to Maghreb prayer.
Iftar meals have been extended inside the Grand Mosque in designated places bringing together a wonderful cultural mixture of fasting people from different nationalities.
Official bodies and a number of associations distributed the iftar meals with the participation of volunteers, which will be seen on a daily basis and with participants from Makkah distributing different types of dates and Zamzam water.
The Presidency of the Two Holy Mosques had granted more than 2,000 permits to provide specific iftar meals that have been prepared and distributed under COVID-19 guidelines, and also prohibiting the use of plastic cups for hot drinks and their distribution in the corridors and at the entrances.
A number of pilgrims and worshipers praised the return of the iftar meals for those who have been fasting to the Grand Mosque after a two-year hiatus.
