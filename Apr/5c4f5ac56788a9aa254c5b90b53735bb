KARAK: Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan joined an iftar in the historic Karak Castle, in the Al Karak Governorate on Tuesday, which hosted a group of women who have contributed to the local community. Queen Rania commended the women for their roles in education, social welfare, culture, volunteering, and humanitarian aid. “Ramadan is always a month of goodwill, blessings, and reconnecting with loved ones, but this year it feels even more special than usual – perhaps because we have been unable to get together for Iftar like this for the past two years,” Queen Rania said.
