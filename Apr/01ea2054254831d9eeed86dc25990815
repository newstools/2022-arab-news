DUBAI: Stagwell, a US-based marketing and media network, has bought Brand New Galaxy, a provider of scaled commerce and marketplace solutions for over 150 global brands and 500 e-retailers worldwide. With 600 employees across Europe, MENA and the US, BNG specializes in digital-first connected commerce solutions scaling. By joining the Stagwell network, it will broaden the group’s e-commerce capabilities to service more complex global clients. BNG has worked with Stagwell since 2021 via the latter’s global affiliate program. The move marks Stagwell's first acquisition of one of its affiliates.  “We are pleased to welcome Brand New Galaxy to the Stagwell platform, expanding the reach of our global e-commerce offerings. Their state-of-the-art e-commerce and digital transformation technology is another reason clients are choosing Stagwell over traditional holding companies,” said Mark Penn, chairman and CEO of Stagwell. As part of Stagwell Media Network, Brand New Galaxy will continue to retain its brand identity, and will operate independently under the BNG brand as well as collaborate with other members of the network. Piotr Morkowski, CEO of Brand New Galaxy Holding, said: “BNG was born as an e-commerce-native business and over the last five years of incredible growth, we have built a set of unique, world-class capabilities to support our global clients across the entire path to purchase. Building a global business of 600 experts in less than five years is no small achievement, but we are hungry to do much more.” Stagwell Media Network now comprises over 3,500 experts across more than 20 countries and 40 offices, managing close to $5 billion in media.
