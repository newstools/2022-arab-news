RIYADH: The Kingdom has signed a deal with the UN to offer consultation services in the fields of survey and geospatial information, as well as boosting national capacity. The General Authority for Survey and Geospatial Information and the United Nations Development Program agreed the third phase of a project that will allow the GASGI to better market its products and services, and increase the level of public awareness of its operations. The agreement covers the areas of geodesy, geospatial information, marine surveys, map production, planning and development. Dr. Adam Bouloukos, the UNDP’s resident representative for Saudi Arabia, said the partnership aimed at providing consultation services concerned with developing national capacity to conduct survey and geospatial works effectively and efficiently. It would also provide the necessary infrastructure for the gathering of data to support Saudi Vision 2030 and the Kingdom’s sustainable development goals.
