RIYADH: The Saudi minister of health, Fahd Al-Jalajel, and the German ambassador to the Kingdom, Dieter Lamle, met in Riyadh to discuss ways in which health cooperation between their countries might be enhanced, along with a number of other issues of common interest.
Following the meeting, the ambassador was given a tour of the Seha Virtual Hospital, which allows patients to visit a local hospital and take part in a video consultation with leading specialists from across the country, and was briefed on the services it provides.
