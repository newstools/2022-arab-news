LONDON: It proved to be a standout day in German sport when play was paused during a Bundesliga match to allow Mainz defender Moussa Niakhate to break his fast. Ramadan started at the beginning of April, during which, those partaking must not eat or drink anything during hours of daylight. So in the 65th minute of of Mainz's trip to Augsburg, referee Matthias Jollenbeck halted proceedings so Niakhate ​could hydrate himself. It was the first time that a Bundesliga game has been stopped to allow a player to break fast during Ramadan. Niakhate took fluids on board from two bottles while speaking to Mainz goalkeeper Robin Zentner. The 26-year-old then applauded the referee for the gesture and ran up to thank Jollenbeck by shaking his hand. Lutz Michael Frohlich, director of communications for the German Referee Committee​, has approved referees stopping games to allow players to break their fast. On Monday, he said: “There is no general instruction in this regard, but of course we support our referees allowing such drinking breaks during Ramadan at the request of the players.” During the match which took place last week, Augsburg took a 2-1 victory over Mainz at home. Over the weekend, there were more examples of referees pausing games to allow players to break their fast. In RB Leipzig's 3-0 win over Hoffenheim on Sunday, referee Bastian Dankert allowed Mohamed Siamakan a few minutes to hydrate. It is a sight that could be seen in the Premier League over the next few weeks during evening kick-offs. Last season in the meeting between Leicester and Crystal Palace at the King Power Stadium, there was a pause in play to allow Foxes defender Wesley Fofana and Eagles midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate to break their fast.
