DUBAI: Residents in the UAE will no longer need a visa sticker in their passport, instead the Emirates ID card will serve as proof of residency, the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Ports Security has said. The rule change applies to all new visa applications after April 11, 2022. The Emirates ID card contains all necessary information on each resident, according to the authorities, and therefore will be used by airlines to verify residency, along with their passport number.
