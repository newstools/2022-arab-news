JEDDAH: The Mohammed bin Salman Foundation has launched the third edition of its 2030 leadership program under the theme “Uncommon Leaders, One Common Goal.” As part of the scheme, which aims to develop Saudi leadership skills, 90 men and women will be selected join the program in the final quarter of 2022. MiSK’s announcement follows the success of the first and second versions of the program, which seeks to develop 1,000 leaders to help meet the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 goals. The nine-month program has been developed in partnership with international organizations, including Esade University, Accenture, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, the Center for Creative Leadership, and Willis Towers Watson. Local authorities and startups will also help to deliver a curriculum that balances global academic excellence with local content. Applicants must have at least 10 years’ experience at executive level in the public, private or nonprofit sector, as well as at least five years’ experience in senior leadership roles. Proficiency in spoken and written English is also essential. According to MiSK, the intensive leadership-building program will include five in-person immersive modules over 25 days, virtual inter-module sessions, executive individual and group coaching sessions, and group assignments. The curriculum combines global and local perspectives, and draws strongly on the Saudi experience, with high-profile guest speakers sharing their insights and experiences. MiSK recently announced that the leadership program’s first and second groups will graduate before the end of 2022. Registration for the program ends on May 17, with further details available at https://misk.org.sa/leaders2030/
