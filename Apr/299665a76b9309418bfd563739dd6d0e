LONDON: A 21-year-old Syrian immigrant was hailed a hero on Wednesday for his role in the capture of the alleged New York subway shooter, with the hashtag #ThankYouZack trending on social media platforms. Zack Tahhan, a security camera technician, was updating equipment at a shop in Manhattan’s East Village when he saw the suspect, Frank James, through one of the security cameras. Tahhan ran out onto the street, following the suspect and warning those around him to keep their distance.  “People think I am crazy, like maybe I am on drugs. But I’m not. I’m fasting,” he said later. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, this is the guy, we need to get him,” Tahhan said. “He was walking down the street. I see the car of the police, I said, ‘Yo, this is the guy.’ We catch him, thank God.” In clips shared on social media, Tahhan is seen explaining the events to reporters and New York residents. Tahhan arrived in the US five years ago from Syria and has since resettled in New Jersey. Jaime Harrison, chairperson of the US Democratic National Committee, took to Twitter to thank Tahhan, while New York Attorney General Letitia James tweeted a video of him, saying: “Thank you for your bravery today, Zack.” She added: “All of New York is grateful.”  Thank you Zack!!! https://t.co/cjJXxlNzAg — Jaime Harrison, DNC Chair (@harrisonjaime) April 13, 2022   Thank you for your bravery today, Zack.

James’ arrest came 30 hours after an attack during the morning commuter rush as the Manhattan-bound N-line train was pulling into an underground station in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park community. The shooting has renewed fears of violence in the city’s subway system.
