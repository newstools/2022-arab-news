RIYADH: Saudi Arabia and Kuwait affirmed their right to exploit the natural resources in their joint Dorra natural gas field. In a joint statement carried by Saudi Press Agency and Kuwait News Agency, the two Gulf nations renewed the call for Iran to hold negotiations on defining the eastern boundary of the submerged divided zone where the field is located. Both countries have previously invited Iran for negotiations, but calls were not met. On March 21, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait signed agreement to begin the work on exploiting the Dorra field. Iran's plans Late in March, Iran has said that it will soon initiate drilling operations at Arash gas field despite the deal by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to jointly develop the giant offshore field, which they refer to as Dorra. According to Iranian media, Iranian Oil Minister Javad Oji wrote on his Twitter page that comprehensive studies of the Arash joint field have been completed by drilling exploratory wells and conducting seismic surveys. Oji stated that although Iran is willing to negotiate and cooperate for the development of joint fields, unilateral measures will not prevent the implementation of the Arash joint field drilling project. Dorra's potential The field is expected to produce 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day with 84,000 barrels of condensate daily. Production will be divided equally between Saudi and Kuwaiti sides. Both countries have also agreed to enable the establishment of Al Khafji joint operations company, which is a joint venture between Kuwait Gulf Oil Co. and Aramco Gulf Operations Co. A consultant will be chosen to conduct the engineering studies necessary to develop the field in accordance with modern technologies and practices. The development of the strategic field will contribute to meeting the growth of domestic demand on natural gas in the two countries.
