A new documentary film titled “Ana Al-Ittihad,” literally meaning “I am Al-Ittihad,” has been released by the current leaders of the Saud Pro League this week. Anmar Al-Haili, president of the club, on Wednesday unveiled the film which tells the history of one of the Kingdom’s, and Arab football’s, most historic teams. The launch was announced at a press conference held at the club’s headquarters in Jeddah in the presence of Louay Gazzaz, chairman of the board of directors of Fox Sport, Saudi director Hamza Tarzan, and international producer Ted Field. The film showcases Al-Ittihad’s history and highlights the early years of Saudi soccer’s move to professionalism. “Our club has a long and honorable history,” Al-Haili said. “Its pages include epic achievements and championships over (many) years, until the present day.” He said the main aim of the film was to preserve the club’s history for future generations.
