An armed man opened fire at a kindergarten in Russia’s central Ulyanovsk region on Tuesday, killing two children and a teacher, the region’s governor said. Another teacher was wounded and is receiving medical help, governor Alexei Russkikh said. The gunman later committed suicide, Interfax news agency reported, citing a source. “I express my deep condolences to the families and friends of the victims. This is an irreplaceable loss for all of us,” Russkikh said in a statement. Investigators have opened a criminal case over the incident, Russia’s Investigative Committee said.
