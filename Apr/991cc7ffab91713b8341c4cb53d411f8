Coming all the way from India to the Arab world, meat samosas are a side dish accompanying the main course during most meals at which they are served, but during Ramadan, the pastry is a staple dish on the iftar table.
Although the samosa was originally triangular and deep fried, it can now be cooked in various ways, including by being air-fried or baked, and is made in different shapes like squares and semi-circles.
While there are many stories of how and when samosas arrived in the region, the most famous and unanimously agreed-on story is that about a century ago, Hadrami merchants brought the golden, crunchy triangles from India to Yemen during the English colonization of the two countries, and then, to the rest of the Arabian Peninsula through commerce, or traveling for Hajj and Umrah.
The price of a samosa in a market goes up during Ramadan because of its high demand, not to mention the huge variation in shapes and fillings. Meat samosas are by far the most popular on the iftar table, followed by cheese samosas and vegetable samosas.
Here’s how you can make this simple dish:
To make the tasty meat samosa, you need to have 300g of minced lamb meat, 1½ tbsp of pine nuts, 1 tbsp chopped coriander, 1 tbsp chopped parsley, 7 spice, salt, pepper, flour and water paste, samosa pastry sheets, and frying oil.
Put the meat in a pan and fry until the meat turns brown, then add the spices, salt, pepper, pine nuts, and coriander and mix well. Let the meat cool down before filling the samosa.
Fold the wrapping sheet into a cone and add the meat, then fold it into a triangle and close it with the paste. After you are done filling and folding all the samosas, fry them on medium-high heat until they turn golden brown, and serve them on the iftar table.
