The samosa is a traditional Asian dish that graces most iftar tables in Muslim households around the world. Although there are many variations on the recipe, the basic recipe remains the same. In some countries, such as India and Pakistan, samosas are made with kneaded dough, whereas in the Middle East the majority of people use samosa pastry wraps filled with a variety of fillings. The fillings can be minced meat, cheese, potatoes and peas, and much more. According to The Times of India, the first mention of samosa was found in the works of the 11th-century Iranian historian Abolfazl Beyhaqi, who wrote that the “sambosa” was small and used as a snack by travelers. Since then the delicious snacks have traveled all over the world and in each culture have found different identities. The samosas in Arab cultures are smaller than the traditional Indian variety, which are most often filled with a spicy mixture of potatoes and peas. The three-cheese samosa recipe we present today is one that will evoke nostalgia for many in the region, but the twist in the recipe will let you experience something new, as well. For the filling, place 400 grams grated white cheese (similar to mascarpone), 150 grams grated mozzarella, 100 grams grated red cheddar, 1 tablespoon chopped mint and 1 tablespoon chopped parsley in a bowl and mix together well. Place a good spoonful of the cheese mixture on a samosa pastry sheet, fold the sheet into a triangle and seal with a paste of flour and water to ensure none of the filling seeps out into the oil. In a pan, heat frying oil, put in the prepared samosas one by one, and fry until golden brown. The result will be 20-25 perfect cheesy samosas with a minty twist that will certainly upgrade your iftar table during Ramadan.
