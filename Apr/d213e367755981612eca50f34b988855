Cookies are some of the most beloved biscuits found in almost every house and offered at social events. The origin of the sweet biscuits in the Kingdom can be traced back to the 7th century, shortly after sugar became a common commodity in the country. The recipe of the cookie then spread to the Arab world through merchants and travelers, reaching Europe through the Muslim conquest of Spain. By the 14th century, cookies became common and available at every strata of society, from royalty to common folk. Cookies were originally produced through a mixture of flour, sugar and a bit of water and oil. But the recipe has been modified over the years and adapted to satisfy every region’s palate. Flavors and toppings such as chocolate chips, sweets and nuts were added to create new, exotic tastes. There are hundreds of cookie recipes, but we are bringing you a healthy version to fit your Ramadan eating pattern. To make keto almond cookies, you will need 230 g almond flour, five tbsp of xylitol or monk fruit, three tbsp of toasted flaked almonds, two tbsp of coconut oil, one tsp of baking powder, 50 ml almond milk and a pinch of salt. Measure and prepare all the ingredients and preheat the oven to 175 degrees Celsius. Mix the almond flour, baking powder, salt, xylitol or monk fruit, coconut oil and almond milk with a spatula until it becomes a smooth paste. Add toasted flaked almonds and mix gently before scooping the paste with a spoon or an ice-cream scoop — to have equal portions — and roll them into small balls and set them evenly on a baking tray. Softly flatten the balls and put the tray in the oven for about 13 to 15 minutes. Once baked, let it cool before serving.
