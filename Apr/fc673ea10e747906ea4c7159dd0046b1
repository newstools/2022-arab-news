RIYADH: The Saudi Ministry of Investment and Janssen, the pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, have launched a national multi-stakeholder campaign to push the health industry in the Kingdom. The campaign, known as Oloumak, aims to encourage and support innovation that will both stimulate the Kingdom’s economy and enhance its healthcare industry, according to a statement. Oloumak also aims to develop momentum across the biomedical value chain in the Kingdom through a number of communication and awareness milestones. It will specifically focus on the role of research and development in the industry. “Through partnerships with our local healthcare authorities and leading international industry players, we are tapping into the immense potential of our healthcare ecosystem to harness innovation and deliver highest quality care,” said the Managing Director of Biotech & Pharma at MISA, Sara Althari. Oloumak seeks to encourage young Saudis to spur homegrown innovation in biotechnology and healthcare and to pursue diverse careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, or STEM.. The Oloumak campaign builds on an earlier agreement signed between MISA and Janssen in June 2021, which established a strategic partnership framework for the two entities to co-develop a range of initiatives over the next five years.
