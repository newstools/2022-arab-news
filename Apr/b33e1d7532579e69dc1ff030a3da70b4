RIYADH: Abu Dhabi-based real estate company Aldar Properties is targeting sales worth 7 to 8 billion dirhams ($1.9 billion to $2.1 billion) during this year, the CEO said in an interview to Al Arabiya. The firm’s target is the highest since its establishment, Talal Al-Dhiyebi added, noting that it aims to launch more than 3,000 residential units during 2022. Al-Dhiyebi said the company achieved solid financial results during the first quarter of 2022, as Egypt’s SODIC that it acquired last year also gave it a boost. The company has long-term plans for the Egyptian market and is looking forward to increasing its investments in the North African country, he explained.
