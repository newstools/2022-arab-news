At first glance, batata harra — Arabic for “spicy potatoes” — looks just like any other regular potato dish, but trust us when we say you won’t be able to get enough of it once you try it! Batata harra is a modern dish that originated in Lebanon as an appetizer, later spreading to neighboring countries and then the whole Middle East. It uses local ingredients and spices, including olive oil, coriander, garlic, pepper and lemon, to create potatoes that are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and bursting with a unique spicy-sour flavor. Batata harra is a simple, time-convenient and satisfying recipe to make at home as all the ingredients are likely already available in your pantry. To make this delicious side dish, you need two large potatoes, 2 tablespoons of olive oil and half a teaspoon of salt. For the sauce, you need 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of pepper paste, one diced red chili, half a lemon juiced, salt and pepper and 2 tablespoons of chopped coriander. Peel the potatoes, dice them into medium-size cubes and mix them with olive oil and salt. Place the potato cubes on a roasting pan and then into a preheated oven or air-fryer at 180 degrees Celsius for 18-20 minutes until the potatoes are crispy. In a bowl, add olive oil, pepper paste, red chili, lemon juice, salt and pepper to make the sauce. Mix the ingredients well, then pour the mixture over the baked potatoes and toss. Place the pan again in the oven for five minutes. Place the spicy potatoes in a serving bowl, garnish them with the chopped coriander and serve.
