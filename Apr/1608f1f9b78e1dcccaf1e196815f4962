RIYADH: The Tadawul All Share Index ended the first quarter of 2022 just under a third higher, despite the ongoing tensions in Ukraine that have driven up oil prices and created uncertainty in the market. Share trades and their value were down compared to Q1 in 2021. By the end of quarter one, TASI had climbed 32 percent compared to a year earlier, following a gain of almost 3,182 points to stand at 13,090 points. It was also the first time the index had exceeded the 13,000 level since 2006. Total equity market capitalization hit SR11 billion ($3 billion), rising 24 percent, compared to the same period last year. TASI had also climbed 16 per cent since the end of 2021, fuelled by a surge in inital public offerings. An unprecedented number of listings led to this outcome, including the listing of Nahdi Medical, which was also the largest listing since that of Aramco. During the period, there were 12.87 billion shares traded, down from 21.81 billion shares traded in the first quarter of 2021. The total value of shares traded dropped 22 percent to SR542 billion ($144.75 billion), compared to the first quarter of 2021. Total transactions during the quarter fell 14.33 percent to reach 23.64 million, compared to 27.59 million during the first quarter of 2021.
