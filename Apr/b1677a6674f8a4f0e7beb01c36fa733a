DOHA: Saudi Arabia have been drawn with Argentina, Mexico and Poland in their group for the FIFA World Cup in Qatar later this year. Herve Renard's charges will open their World Cup account against much-fancied Argentina on November 22. They then take on Poland four days later, followed by Mexico on Nov. 30. Hosts Qatar, who will open the tournament on Nov. 21 against Ecuador, were drawn with Netherlands and recently-crowned African champions Senegal. North African rivals Tunisia and Morocco both received tough draws, with the Eagles of Carthage drawn to face reigning world champions France, along with Denmark and the winners of a playoff between Peru and UAE or Australia. The Atlas Lions, meanwhile, will play European powerhouses Belgium and Croatia, as well as an in-form Canada; playing in their second World Cup and their first since 1986. As in 1998, Iran will face the USA, with diplomatic relations yet to be restored between the nations, and England, whose government has endured tense relations with Tehran. The group could yet be completed by Ukraine, whose ability to qualify for the World Cup has been postponed by being invaded by Russia, who will face Scotland in a playoff followed by a final match-up against Wales in Cardiff in June. Here is a full look at all the groups in the Nov. 21-Dec. 18 tournament: GROUP A — Qatar, Netherlands, Senegal, Ecuador GROUP B — England, United States, Iran, Wales/Scotland/Ukraine GROUP C — Argentina, Mexico, Poland, Saudi Arabia GROUP D — France, Denmark, Tunisia, Peru/Australia/UAE GROUP E — Spain, Germany, Japan, Costa Rica/New Zealand GROUP F — Belgium, Croatia, Morocco, Canada GROUP G — Brazil, Switzerland, Serbia, Cameroon GROUP H — Portugal, Uruguay, South Korea, Ghana
