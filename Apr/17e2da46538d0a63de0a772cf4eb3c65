RIYADH: Lebanon’s Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Latif Deryan welcomed the return of Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Beirut on Monday. In a press statement, the mufti said that Lebanon does not envisage itself without the protection of the Kingdom. He added that his country has always supported the Kingdom’s return to Lebanon as per the constitution and the Taif Agreement, and that it was proud of its Arab identity. Deryan said the move highlighted the keenness of the Kingdom and Arab Gulf states on maintaining good relations with Lebanon in order to keep the country in the Arab world. “We are interested in relations between the Kingdom and Lebanon, and hope that Lebanese-Arab relations will remain at the highest level of rapprochement and fraternity. As long as things are going in the right direction, and as long as we maintain the right path, these relations will be good and there will be no future crises with Saudi Arabia,” the mufti said. He added that he had asked Lebanese President Michel Aoun to work on resuming solidarity between Lebanon and Arab states, calling on all Lebanese people to spare no effort to ensure that Lebanese-Arab ties are at their best for the benefit of all Lebanese citizens.
