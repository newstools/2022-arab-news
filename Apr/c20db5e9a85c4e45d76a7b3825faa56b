CAIRO: Egypt has extended a previously-set time for holding Eid al-Fitr prayers, allowing mosques to open half an hour before prayer time. The statement by the ministry of endowments extends a previously announced timing that set 10 minutes for holding eid prayers. However, the ministry said the prayers are to be held in major mosques only, and that it won't be allowed in open public spaces this year due to coronavirus concerns.
