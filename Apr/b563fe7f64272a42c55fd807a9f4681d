Jayne McGivern was recently appointed CEO of the Sports Boulevard Foundation. A Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, McGivern has more than 35 years of experience in overseeing infrastructure megaprojects which act as catalysts for urban redevelopment. She joined the Sports Boulevard Foundation from Madison Square Garden Co., a global entertainment business, where she was president of development and construction, with responsibility for overseeing the construction and delivery of the MSG Spheres, and integrating groundbreaking technology into large scale venues around the world from 2018. McGivern was given a place on the board of directors of Skanska AB, the fifth-largest construction company in the world in 2015, according to Construction Global magazine. In 2019, Cairn Homes, a leading Irish homebuilding company, announced McGivern’s appointment as one of three new independent non-executive directors. She also served as a non-executive director for a three-year term on the board of Crossrail, a railway construction project in central London, from 2014. Australian firm Multiplex also appointed her as its UK chief executive to oversee the construction of Wembley Stadium in the British capital in 2008. McGivern spearheaded the creation and delivery of several large development projects, including in her prior roles as CEO of the European Division of Multiplex, and managing director of Anschutz Entertainment Group in London, during its acquisition and redevelopment of The O2 (formerly the Millennium Dome), which remains the single largest planning application ever granted in the UK.
