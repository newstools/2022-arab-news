LONDON: The UAE has welcomed the announcement of an UN-brokered truce in Yemen and the halt of all military operations there and on the Saudi-Yemeni border, the UAE’s state news agency WAM reported on Saturday.
The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation stressed its support for all efforts made by the UN envoy to enhance prospects for peace and stability in Yemen and the region, and the importance of Saudi Arabia’s pivotal role in achieving stability and security for Yemen, reiterating its commitment to stand by the Yemeni people and support their legitimate aspirations for development and prosperity.
Bahrain praised the response of the leadership of the Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen and said it hopes that it will constitute an important step as an opportunity to stop the war in Yemen, reach a comprehensive political settlement between the Yemeni parties, and return security, stability and peace to the country.
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation praised the efforts of UN envoy to Yemen Hans Grundberg, expressing hope that the truce would ease the suffering of the Yemeni people, and provide appropriate conditions for the Yemeni parties to reduce escalation and reach a comprehensive political settlement to the conflict.
Oman, Qatar, the Arab League and the European Union also issued similar statements welcoming the truce.
