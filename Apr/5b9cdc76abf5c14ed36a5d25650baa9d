Mayssa Jallad & Khaled Allaf For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle  ‘Madina min Baeed’ Jallad’s is one of the finest singing voices in the region, and this collaboration with Syrian musician and producer Allaf is a moving, haunting piece with minimal electronic music backing Jallad’s vocals. The video, directed by Cannes-winner Ely Dagher serves the song perfectly — what starts out as apparently seductive and alluring breaking apart to reveal chaos and decay. Stella McCartney  ‘Crystal Exclusives’ The UK fashion designer has released her first Ramadan-specific line — a ‘gift edit’ featuring a mini shoulder bag and a mesh-stretch mule shoe from the designer’s Summer 2022 collection “reimagined in glittering jewels and gold tones.” As is customary for McCartney, both items are vegan and made from cruelty-free materials. They also include lead-free crystals. The edit will be available in Dubai, Riyadh and Kuwait City. Telechild  ‘Turn On Your Favorite Show’ The Lebanese duo — Hadi Baba and Charles Anouzi — first teamed up musically at university, before reuniting in Dubai. They dropped their debut album last month. It was recorded with some stellar talent, including Nour Nimri on vocals and Postcards’ Marwan Tohme on bass, while indie luminary Fadi Tabbal produced the record, which is a collection of guitar-driven old-school alt-rock tracks with some modern electronic flourishes. Sarah Machlab  ‘Simple’ The UAE-based Lebanese singer-songwriter’s second LP is a stripped-back affair based around “downtempo electronica and acoustic music,” according to a press release. Lyrically, Machlab explains, the 14-track album is “about spring as a metaphor for rebirth — reconnecting with nature and with oneself.”
