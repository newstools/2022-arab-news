DUBAI: Snap is launching what it claims to be the first-ever augmented reality-led virtual mall in the Middle East and North Africa region, featuring leading brands such as L’Oreal, IKEA, Namshi and Samsung.
The virtual mall can be accessed via a Snapchat World Lens through the platform’s outward-facing camera, allowing users to browse the virtual stores of the participating brands. Within each store, people can view and explore products, and go on to purchase them through the brand’s e-commerce site.
The virtual mall lens can be accessed through the lens carousel on the home camera screen. Brand store lenses will also be available alongside the organic lenses on Snapchat’s Lens Explorer tab.
Ramadan is a critical period for retailers, and Snap’s virtual mall aims to provide retailers with another channel for capturing users’ attention and driving sales. Last year, for instance, Ramadan campaigns for retailers running an AR lens on Snapchat delivered a 4.3 times higher average purchase value compared to other formats.
Jake Thomas, head of the UAE department at Snap Inc. said: “Snapchatters in the region are seeking inspiration for their shopping experience this Ramadan. Today, shoppers want an experience that is more than just transactional.”
While consumers expect “the convenience and efficiency of online shopping, they also want a true-to-life, in-store experience,” he added.
AR combines the best of both worlds, said Thomas, “when accessed through universally available and always-on mobile devices — a game-changer for both retailers and shoppers.”
