RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry announced on Thursday the return of the Kingdom’s ambassador to Lebanon. The move comes in response to the “calls and appeals of moderate national political forces in Lebanon, and in confirmation of the Lebanese prime minister’s statement of the government’s commitment to take the necessary and required measures to enhance cooperation with the Kingdom and Gulf Cooperation Council countries and to stop all political, military, and security activities affecting the Kingdom and GCC countries,” Saudi Press Agency reported. The Kingdom stressed the importance of Lebanon's return to its Arab origins, represented by its national institutions and agencies, in order for the country to enjoy peace and security, and for its people to enjoy stability. Prime Minister Najib Mikati later tweeted his appreciation for the decision and affirmed that “Lebanon is proud of its Arab affiliation.” “Lebanon is committed to the best relations with Gulf states, which were and will remain a support” to us, Mikati added. Kuwait also announced the return of its ambassador to Beirut. The presidency of the council of ministers in Lebanon said that Kuwait’s ambassador Abdelaal Al-Qenaei had informed the prime minister that he would return to Beirut before the end of the week. Mikati stressed that “what brings Lebanon and Kuwait together is a history of close brotherly relations that are becoming more and more solid with the passing of time.”
