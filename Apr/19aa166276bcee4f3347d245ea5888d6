MAKKAH: King Salman arrived at Al-Safa Palace in Makkah from Jeddah on Friday night, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported. Images released on Saturday morning by SPA showed the king praying at the Grand Mosque. He will spend the last part of Ramadan in the holy city and will also offer Eid prayer there. The king has received foreign dignitaries, including the leaders of Turkey and Yemen, in Jeddah this week. Muslim leaders often come to the Kingdom during the last days of Ramadan, which are considered blessed, to perform Umrah — the lesser pilgrimage — in Makkah’s Grand Mosque.
