AMMAN: Jordan’s King Abdullah is scheduled to depart for Germany on Sunday to undergo surgery to treat a thoracic herniated disc. In a brief statement on Saturday, the Jordanian Royal Court said that the surgery will take place at a specialized hospital in Frankfurt, Germany this week. The statement said that the decision to undergo surgery was taken upon the professional advice of Jordanian physicians who examined the king. The Royal Court said that the king had previously been experiencing intermittent pain in the spinal cord after years of parachuting while serving in the Special Forces. The pressure on the nerve due to the herniation had increased lately, which calls for urgent surgery, according to medical advice. The surgery will be followed by a period of rest for around a week before the king returns to Jordan, the statement added.
