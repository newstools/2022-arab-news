RIYADH: The Saudi Red Crescent Authority and Saudi Development and Reconstruction Program for Yemen has announced that they would jointly provide 30 ambulances and emergency response vehicles for Yemen’s health sector. The announcement came during the signing of a memorandum of cooperation between the SRCA and the SDRPY in Riyadh that aims to unify Saudi efforts in building and raising the level of healthcare services provided in Yemen. During the signing, the SDRPY was represented by the Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed bin Saeed Al-Jaber, who is also the general supervisor of the program, and the SRCA’s president, Jalal bin Mohammed Alowaisi. The SDRPY has had a longstanding commitment to development support in Yemen. The SDRPY has already contributed over $76 million to Yemen’s health sector so far through 19 projects and six development initiatives, supporting 17 medical centers with equipment, and providing close to 600 devices to hospitals and other centers. Alowaisi said the SRCA and the SDRPY were complying with a royal order that urges all ministries to cooperate so that Yemen’s reconstruction and aid initiatives can be streamlined. Further humanitarian programs would soon be announced, he said. Al-Jaber said: “The first fruits of cooperation sees today the provision and allocation of 30 ambulances and emergency response vehicles in support of hospitals and medical centers in a number of Yemeni cities.” He added that there was an urgent need to provide support for the health sector in that country. The MoU states that it would focus on improving medical infrastructure, facilitate access to healthcare and develop the quality and effectiveness of services provided to the Yemeni people.
