RIYADH: Saudi Arabia will continue blocking call facilities on apps that do not comply with regulatory and safety protocols in the country, according to Abdullah Al-Swaha, Minister of Communications and Information Technology. In a televised interview, the minister made it clear that no one will be allowed to cross what he sees as a red line, which guards the nation's security and sovereignty. The minister noted that maintaining the confidentiality of customers’ data has emerged as a global challenge, due to the fact that people used to share sensitive data with social media platforms negligently. Al-Swaha added that the government has detected and prosecuted some companies that sold customers' data. He also asserted that the primary role of the government is to create awareness, and set laws and regulations.
