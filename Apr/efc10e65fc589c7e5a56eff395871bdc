RIYADH: Saudi Arabia was recently elected chair of the 25th session of the UN Commission on Science and Technology for Development, a subsidiary body of the UN Economic and Social Council. The Kingdom was represented by Director-General of International Affairs of the Communications and Information Technology Commission Eng. Mansour Al-Qurashi. The session was held between March 28 and April 1 at the UN headquarters in Geneva. This achievement reflects the Kingdom’s active participation in international organizations, its contributions to strengthening the digital infrastructure of developing countries, its pioneering role in the field of communications and information technology in the region and its advanced ranking among G20 countries in terms of market capitalization. During the session, which was held in the presence of many high-level officials, the participants reviewed topics including the Fourth Industrial Revolution and how to harness science, technology and innovation for sustainable civilized development in the post-pandemic world. They further reviewed the progress made in implementing the objectives of the World Summit on the Information Society at the regional and international levels. The CSTD, which includes 43 countries, was established in 1992 to offer advice to the UN General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. The commission advises on issues related to science and technology and their effects on development, advancing their policies in developing countries and formulating recommendations and guidelines in this regard within the UN. The commission is also responsible for the periodic follow-up on the implementation of the objectives of the WSIS. Saudi Arabia’s nomination to chair the CSTD for the first time since 1992 strengthens the Kingdom’s leading international and regional position in terms of the commission’s work.
