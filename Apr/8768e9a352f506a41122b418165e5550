LONDON: Supporters of an up-and-coming British boxing star have paid tribute to the 18-year-old after he died in a car accident. Ali Tazeem was dubbed the “next Amir Khan” and had signed a professional contract just a month before his death. He previously trained with legendary boxer and trainer Floyd Mayweather Sr. Tazeem’s promoter took to Twitter to pay tribute to the young star. “This morning I woke up to the news that Ali Tazeem has passed away at the age of 18. I can’t believe it. I can’t even process it properly. “We only spoke yesterday talking about how he was going to light up the pro game, all I can think about is Ali and his lovely family.” Amir Khan, one of Britain’s most successful boxers, previously praised Tazeem, saying “he will be the next me and make history.”
