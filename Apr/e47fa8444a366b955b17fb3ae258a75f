NEW YORK: The UN Security Council on Monday strongly condemned the cross-border terrorist attacks by the Houthi militia against Saudi Arabia last month. The Iranian-backed Houthis struck critical civilian infrastructure in the Kingdom on March 20 and 25. The Security Council expressed its expectation and demand that the Houthis abide by the terms of a “welcomed” truce, which came into effect on April 2, and immediately cease all cross-border attacks. They further recalled the Houthis’ obligations under international law, including those related to the protection of civilians and civilian objects. During a session on Monday, the members of the Security Council also underscored the opportunity the truce affords to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of Yemenis and improve regional stability. The members urged the building of confidence through measures such as, but not limited to, the re-opening of Taiz road and the regular flow of fuel deliveries, goods, and flights, in accordance with the agreed truce. The Security Council called on all parties to seize the opportunity provided by the truce and work with the UN Special Envoy to make progress towards a comprehensive ceasefire and an inclusive political settlement. It also expressed full support for the UN Special Envoy’s political consultation efforts, reiterated the urgency of an inclusive Yemeni-led, Yemeni-owned process, under UN auspices, and underscored the importance of a minimum 30 per cent participation in them by women in line with the Outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference as recalled by resolution 2624 (2022). It welcomed the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative for Yemeni-Yemeni dialogue which launched last week in Riyadh, in support of the UN’s own efforts and expressed deep concern about Yemen’s humanitarian crisis and underlined the urgent need to fund the humanitarian response.
