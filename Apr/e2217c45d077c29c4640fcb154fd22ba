RIYADH: Electric Marine Racing Co., or E1 Series, has officially launched the innovative electric racing boat that it announced last year in partnership with Saudi Public Investment Fund. The boat, RaceBird, took flight for the first time on the River Po in northern Italy, after completing a series of tests and performance runs with ex-powerboat world champion Luca Ferrari behind the wheel, E1 Series said in a statement. The single pilot vessel is powered by a 150 kilowatt Kreisel battery and a Mercury Racing outboard motor, with the boat lifting onto its foils, allowing torque and acceleration. “In the coming weeks, we’ll continue to run further tests and gather the necessary data. I’m really looking forward to showing it in public for the first time, which we’ll be announcing more on shortly,” the E1 CEO, Rodi Basso, said. “This test marks the first page of a new chapter in the electrification of the marine industry, focusing on accelerating future technologies for the benefit of our waters,” he added. The RaceBird is a product of Saudi PIF and E1 Series partnership to create the world’s first electric powerboat racing competition. PIF’s partnership with E1 Series comes as part of its efforts to enable innovation globally, open new horizons for future industries and build strategic economic partnerships.
