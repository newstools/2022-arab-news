JEDDAH: The General Secretariat of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation has strongly condemned escalating daily attacks and crimes committed by the Israeli occupation forces against the Palestinian people, their property and institutions. In particular it highlighted the situation in the occupied city of Al-Quds, where it said violations of the sanctity of Al-Aqsa Mosque and barbaric attacks against worshipers continue. The organization called on the international community, especially the UN Security Council, to put pressure on Israel to abide by the principles of international law and international treaties and conventions and halt attacks against the Palestinian people and their institutions. Separately, Hissein Brahim Taha, the OIC’s secretary-general welcomed a decision by the de facto authorities in Kabul outlawing all poppy harvesting in Afghanistan. The order also bans the manufacture, trade and transport of narcotics. He said that the strict prohibition of poppy cultivation is in line with a commitment by the current government in Afghanistan to implement effective drug-control measures. The cultivation of alternative high-value crops as well as rehabilitation programs for Afghans suffering from drug addiction should form essential parts of the international community’s assistance and reconstruction efforts in the country, he added.
