DUBAI: Elon Musk has offered to buy Twitter at $54.20 per share, just days after refusing to join the social media company’s board of directors.  I made an offer https://t.co/VvreuPMeLu — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 14, 2022  News of the bid set the internet, and especially Twitter, on fire. The Twitch streamer and social media influencer known as “Arab” on Instagram and YouTube and “Your Fellow Arab” on Twitter said he was excited by Musk’s offer.  HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA NO WAY https://t.co/8cWSml58H7 — Arab (@YourFellowArab) April 14, 2022  “Twitter is my favorite platform and Elon Musk is a god amongst men,” he told Arab News. “If they sell Twitter to him, I know he will succeed.” But Saudi businessman Prince Al Waleed bin Talal, who is chairman of Kingdom Holding Co., Rotana and Al Waleed Philanthropies, was less impressed. “Being one of the largest & long-term shareholders of Twitter, @Kingdom_KHC & I reject this offer,” he said in a tweet.  I don't believe that the proposed offer by @elonmusk ($54.20) comes close to the intrinsic value of @Twitter given its growth prospects. Being one of the largest & long-term shareholders of Twitter, @Kingdom_KHC & I reject this offer.https://t.co/Jty05oJUTk pic.twitter.com/XpNHUAL6UX — الوليد بن طلال (@Alwaleed_Talal) April 14, 2022  Meanwhile, Dubai-based Dr. Petar Stojanov, who leads the innovation and future strategy practice at global design and innovation advisory Black, explained the potential backlash if Twitter rejects Musk’s offer.  https://t.co/MXrU6KZ3mV If the board says ‘no’, they’ll have to show shareholders how they will get them to 20% premium over stock price in the next year.

Twitter said its board of directors would “carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and all Twitter stockholders.” Hassan Sajwani, a social media influencer with more than 100,000 followers, posted a series of tweets about the offer.
