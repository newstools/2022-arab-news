RIYADH: The King Khalid Foundation has launched an awareness campaign to support the nonprofit sector in the Kingdom. The campaign celebrates the month of giving, in which Saudi NGOs are most active, to serve society and the less fortunate. During the holy month of Ramadan, the Kingdom witnesses a rush in charity work from individuals and charities, who support, volunteer, donate and participate in other activities in the nonprofit sector. This is the third time the King Khalid Foundation’s campaign has been launched and it is adopting the hashtag #Trustworthy on social media. Hundreds of nonprofit organizations have participated in the awareness campaign with the aim of portraying a positive image of the Saudi nonprofit sector and its developmental role. The campaign aims to enhance the community’s confidence in NGOs and encourage participation, volunteering, donation and membership in nonprofit organizations. It emphasizes the crucial role of the Saudi nonprofit sector as a reliable development partner that adheres to the highest standards of governance, accountability and transparency and contributes directly to achieving the Kingdom’s Vision 2030. The King Khalid Foundation encourages individuals and entities to double their efforts during the holy month of Ramadan this year to support NGOs in the Kingdom, given the essential role of organizations in social development and prosperity. Established in 2001, the foundation works to promote equal opportunities in Saudi society, build the capabilities of the nonprofit sector, increase its social and development impact and contribute to supporting decision-makers in developing national policies to achieve social development.
