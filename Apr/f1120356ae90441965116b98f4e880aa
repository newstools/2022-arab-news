CAIRO: Egypt’s Food Safety Authority has given Indomie Egypt 48 hours to pull some of its products from Egyptian markets saying they are unsafe for human consumption. The authority announced on Tuesday that Indomie’s chicken and vegetable flavored instant noodles, as well as instant noodles with chili packs “are unfit for human consumption,” Ahlam Online reported. Food safety tests found that Indomie’s chili packets and the chicken and vegetable flavor packets contained “aflatoxins and pesticide residues in quantities that exceeded safe limits.” But other than those three products, Indomie instant noodles were generally found to be safe for human consumption.
