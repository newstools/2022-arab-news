CAIRO: EgyptAir has announced that it resumed direct flights between Cairo and Benghazi on Monday, after an eight-year hiatus due to insecurity in Libya. Amr Abol-Enein, chairman of the board of directors of the holding company for EgyptAir, said there will be a daily direct flight between the two cities. He added that the move comes within the framework of the company’s plan to strengthen its presence in Africa. “The company pays special attention to points of strategic importance, including the city of Benghazi, especially with the presence of many Egyptians residing and working in Libya, in addition to the endeavor to enhance trade and economic exchange between Egypt and Libya,” he said. Last September, both countries’ civil aviation authorities agreed to take the necessary measures to resume flights between Libyan airports and Cairo. That month, Afriqiyah Airways and Libyan Airlines resumed flights from Mitiga and Benina airports to Cairo.
