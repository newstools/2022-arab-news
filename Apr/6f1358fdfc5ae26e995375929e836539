JEDDAH: Experts and officials from the field of literature have taken part in an online meeting to discuss the development of the science fiction and fantasy genre within the Kingdom. Organized by the Literature, Publishing and Translation Commission, the “Literature of Science Fiction and Fantasy” event was held on April 18. Participants shared their views on the challenges faced by the sector and discussed ways to best support creative output. One of the most popular suggestions was the establishment of a literary prize for science fiction writing within the Arab world. The initiative would be based in Saudi Arabia but seek to nurture talent and encourage the publication of literary works across all Arab nations. The meeting also urged the commission to provide greater media exposure for Arab writers of science fiction and fantasy novels, and promote their involvement in local and international literary forums and conferences. The participants highlighted the importance of workshops and training courses in supporting and nurturing talent, and suggested greater cooperation with scientific agencies like the Saudi Space Commission. The meeting also discussed ways to improve the marketing of sci-fi and fantasy publications within bookstores, and considered how literary agents and writers could work together to have their publications translated into other languages. More effort should also be made to adapt science fiction works by Saudi writers into cinematic and television productions, the participants said. The LPTC was set up in 2020 under the Ministry of Culture and is headed by Dr. Mohammad Hasan Alwan. Its aim is to promote locally produced works both at home and overseas.
