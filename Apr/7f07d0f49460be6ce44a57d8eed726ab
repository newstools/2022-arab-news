RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s largest retail pharmacy chain, Nahdi Medical Co., has launched its largest flagship pharmacy in Riyadh, in a bid to elevate its retail experience. The new pharmacy, spanning 2,800 sqm, will be equipped with a wide spectrum of services, including curbside pickup, pharmacy-to-home delivery service, e-pharmacist service and self-checkout service. It also offers a key service, Nahdi express clinic, which enables access to primary health care services, such as preliminary tests and examinations by a clinical pharmacist. “Our flagship pharmacies allow us to cater to the comprehensive needs of our guests, by providing them with a superior shopping experience and access to the full range of health and wellbeing products and services, thereby adding to their lives every day,” CEO Yasser Joharji said. The move is an evolution of the company’s network of non-urgent care centers, which is expected to grow significantly in the medium term.
