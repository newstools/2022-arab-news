DUBAI: Palestinian-Dutch supermodel Bella Hadid called out Instagram this week for “shadow banning” her Palestine-related posts. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle “My Instagram has disabled me from posting on my story — pretty much only when it is Palestine based I’m going to assume,” she wrote to her 51 million followers. “When I post about Palestine I get immediately shadowbanned and almost 1 million less of you see my stories and posts.”   Following this story, the catwalk star posted a series of videos and pictures of the Palestinian clashes with Israeli riot police inside Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque on Friday. Most of the Palestinian injuries were incurred from rubber bullets, stun grenades and beatings with police batons, the Palestine Red Crescent said, at the most sensitive site in the generations-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “These are the people you are shooting with rubber bullets,” Hadid’s posts read as she shared a video of a helpless family whose father was shot. “This is a power trip and a disgusting form of abuse. During the holy month of Ramadan. How dare they.”
