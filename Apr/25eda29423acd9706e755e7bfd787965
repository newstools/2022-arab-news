A post shared by Nora Maria Attal (@noraattal) “I am grateful to have people around me who support me, who are there for me when I need them,” she said. “The moments I look most forward to during Eid are the celebrations, being together, having the big meal that you usually make together as a family,” she added, while her mother said: “Family is everything.” In the video, the family also share gifts from the brand and pose for a group picture taken by Bastidas.  A post shared by Nora Maria Attal (@noraattal) “Thank you @ralphlauren for making my family apart of this,” Attal wrote. “These moments are so special.” In November 2020, the model and her family fronted the brand’s holiday campaign. London-based Attal was discovered by Jonathan Anderson, founder of the JW Anderson label, and shot a campaign for the British label in 2014 before she had even appeared on a catwalk. She is signed to Viva Model Management and has walked the runway for major fashion houses, including Fendi, Burberry and Valentino.
