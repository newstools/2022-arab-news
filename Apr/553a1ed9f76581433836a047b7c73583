Just as many regions of the world have their own distinct varieties of pickle, kabis is the popular Arabic version, and is often served with chicken and meat dishes. Pickled and fermented foods contain natural probiotics and are an important part of dietary health. An added benefit is that kabis are simple to prepare compared with pickles made in countries such as Pakistan and South Korea, where strong spices are used in the recipe. Turnips, beetroot and cucumbers are among the most popular vegetables for kabis, but other vegetables are also suitable. To make your own kabis you will need, 7-8 baby cucumbers, 3 small carrots, ¼ bunch of cauliflower, and 1 clove of garlic. Cut up the vegetables in roughly equal sizes and put them in a jar. For the pickling liquid, pour in a saucepan ½ cup of water, ½ cup distilled vinegar, 2 tbsp salt, 1 tsp sugar and ½ tsp peppercorns. Turn the heat on low, and stir the liquid until the sugar and salt are completely dissolved. Set the liquid aside to cool. Once it is cool, pour over the vegetables. Use something to weigh down the vegetables so they are completely submerged. Set the jar aside on the kitchen counter at room temperature and allow the pickling process to start. Wait at least a week before eating. Kabis can be served with main dishes or with snacks and sandwiches.
