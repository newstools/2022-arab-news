RIYADH: Around 1.3 million iftar meals have been distributed to visitors at the Prophet’s Mosque in Madinah during the first third of Ramadan.   Over 1.2 million bottles of Zamzam were distributed to worshippers at the mosque during the same period. In addition to this, 14,000 dispensing containers dotted around the mosque are filled three times a day to provide an adequate amount of the holy water to visitors.   More than 6 million people visited the mosque during the first ten days of Ramadan and nearly 300,000 worshippers were able to pray in the Holy Rawdah after booking a time slot to do so.   The Holy Rawdah lies between the Sacred Chamber (known as the Prophet’s house), and the Prophet’s Minbar (or pulpit). This southeastern section of the Prophet’s Mosque is where his house once stood, where he lived with his wife Aisha bint Abu Bakr and is buried. It is of extremely great religious value to Muslims.
