It’s also a relaxed and informal activity that takes them out of the formal business setting,” Al-Mozaini said. During the walk, women shared ideas and were offered mentorship advice. The initiative was brought to life by the Eastern Province Council for Social Responsibility, with strategic sponsorship from Monshaat, the General Authority for Small and Medium Enterprises. Nusf plans to hold the walk every year to celebrate International Women’s Day and hopes to expand the initiative to cities around the Kingdom.
