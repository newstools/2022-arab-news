DUBAI: Palestinian singer and songwriter Rasha Nahas will perform tracks from her upcoming album “AMRAT” at this year’s Women of the World festival from March 11 to 13 in London. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle Nahas’ show will take place on the first day of the three-day event at the Queen Elizabeth Hall Foyer. The Berlin-based singer will provide fans a sneak preview of tracks from her unreleased album and perform several of her previous hits. Her new album, which follows the release of her debut “Desert” in 2021, consists of songs that tackle heavy, emotional subjects. The album, which is scheduled for release in summer, weaves together both classical and new music, creating a rich soundscape with tinges of the modern and rustic. Although Nahas was born and raised in Haifa and has sung exclusively in English, this is about to change with her new musical project featuring Arabic lyrics for the first time. The event is part of the Women of the World Foundation, which was created as a global movement in 2010 to raise awareness of the challenges facing women and girls and to celebrate their achievements. The foundation’s work has reached over 3 million people in more than 25 locations. The artist will share the billing with a diverse group of female artists, activists, comedians and speakers, including Somali poet Warsan Shire, authors Pandora Sykes and Lisa Taddeo, political activist Angela Davis and Irish writer Marian Keyes.
