RIYADH: As Saudi Arabia looks to strengthen its domestic defense manufacturing capabilities, the country’s premium King Fahd University has created several programs to develop the human capacity that can “truly localize defense technology,” according to Muhammad Al-Saggaf, president of the university. Talking at the World Defense Show in Riyadh on March 6, Al-Saggaf emphasized the need to extend cooperation by employers to attract more students to defense-related jobs. “The talent is not available because the industry hasn’t made available these jobs; students aren’t attracted to it,” he said. Al-Saggaf also added that the university’s defence-related programs will help companies to sponsor students before they graduate.
