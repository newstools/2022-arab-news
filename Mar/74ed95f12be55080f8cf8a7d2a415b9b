DUBAI: Lebanese designer Rabih Kayrouz teamed up with renowned Paris-based swimwear and lingerie brand Eres for a holiday-inspired capsule collection just in time for the summer. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle The 10-piece collection includes six loungewear pieces and four swimsuit designs inspired by women traveling and enjoying the sun. Kayrouz said that the collection is meant to invoke his memories of “the great and beautiful years of Beirut,” where he grew up before fleeing to Paris aged 16 following the civil war. The offering comprises all the travel wardrobe essentials and is designed to seamlessly transition shoppers with ease from lounging beachside during the day to dinner at a restaurant in the evening. Eres creative director Marie-Paule Minchelli was responsible for creating the swimwear, while former ANDAM finalist Kayrouz was tasked with designing the ready-to-wear items.   “I have this obsession — creating an ideal wardrobe for the woman I love. I wanted to complete it with swimwear, so teaming up with Eres went without saying,” he said to WWD. The pair envisioned the collection for the warm weather season, churning out a lineup of oversized separates, loose trousers, two-piece and one-piece swimsuits, shirts and a tennis cap. The Lebanese designer’s signature hand-drawn inkblot leopard print he imagined in 2013 is used throughout the collection. Meanwhile, material like gold lame, a persistent feature in Karyouz’s ready-to-wear and couture collections, is also present in the lineup. The new collection will be released on March 21 at select Eres stores around the world, on the Eres website and at Kayrouz’s Boulevard Raspail showroom in Paris. Prices start from $242 to $716.
