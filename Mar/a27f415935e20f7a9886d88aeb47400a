The Fazaa mobile application is a portable charging and power bank rental service that comes in handy when your device’s battery has run low.
Meaning “help” in Saudi slang, Fazaa allows you to check the location of the company’s booths and the availability of power banks.
Once you find it, the application will ask you to scan a QR code to rent a power bank or allow you to charge your device in a slot.
This service is such a lifesaver. I was out with friends one night and forgot to take my portable charger with me. With no one able to help, I found a Fazaa station at a restaurant and was able to charge my phone in one of the slots.
The station has very good security and users can be assured that their phones are safe.
Fazaa is available for download on Google Play, App Store, and Huawei’s AppGallery.
The rental stations are ready for use round-the-clock across the Kingdom, including shopping malls, restaurants, cafes, parks, and other public places.
Fazaa uses state-of-the-art power banks that are safe, and provides different types of charging cables including Apple Lightning, MicroUSB and Type-C. These devices are powerful and will charge your mobile in no time.
The first 15 minutes, once a day, are free of charge. After that, a fee of SR15 ($4) is required every 24 hours. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle
