LONDON: Morad Tahbaz, the British-Iranian dual national jailed in Tehran’s Evin prison for over four years, has been “left behind” by the UK government, his daughter claims. Roxanne Tahbaz told the BBC that the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office promised that her father would be freed alongside Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori, who returned to the UK earlier this month. But Roxanne said her father, a wildlife conservationist, is a “pawn” in a “political chess game,” and the UK government told the family not to talk to the media. “We feel no one is really protecting him now as his country has left him behind,” she told the BBC’s “Today” radio program. “Despite the foreign office’s advice to stay quiet and out of the press and the media, (we) are shedding light and trying to garner some support and ask some questions because he never should have been left behind. “We’ve been told they’re working on it, that it’s complicated, as the Iranians see him as an American.”
