JAKARTA: The Saudi-sponsored Prince Sultan competition for the memorization of the Holy Qur’an and the Prophet’s Sunnah ended here recently with senior scholars urging Muslims to follow Islamic principles of moderation, and to reject extremism. Indonesian Vice President Ma’ruf Amin and Saudi Islamic Minister Sheikh Abdullatif Al-Asheikh were present at the closing ceremony. Also in attendance were Indonesia’s Vice-Minister of Religious Affairs Zain Al-Tawhid, Saudi Ambassador to Indonesia Essam Al-Thaqafi, several ambassadors from Arab and Islamic countries, and heads of universities and Islamic societies. Addressing the attendees, Al-Asheikh said: “There is nothing greater than a person helping another build their character through the support and assistance of educational institutions in all their specializations. Its return to man and society will be very great.” He stressed the need for Muslims to be “virtuous … patient … advocates of goodness, peace and love, (and) to follow the approach that God has set (down), which is moderation, rejecting violence and extremism, spreading compassion and the principles of respect for all human beings.” “Muslims must set a good example when dealing with others, whether with Muslims or people from other religions.” He said Muslim scholars had a “great responsibility” to propagate the correct teachings of Islam, and counter those “extremists who want to terrorize people for political or worldly interests, or (spread) hatred that contradicts what God has commanded us.” Al-Tawhid praised the Kingdom for continuing to support the competition for the sake of Muslims in Indonesia and globally.
