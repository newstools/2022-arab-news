DUBAI: Bloomberg Media is expanding its presence in the Middle East with the establishment of a creative studio in Dubai. The studio is part of Bloomberg’s branded content division, Bloomberg Media Studios. It will comprise creative and business professionals that will work along with the Bloomberg Media commercial team to serve clients across the region. “Our Europe, Middle East and Africa businesses have grown dramatically in the past two years, requiring us to expand our Bloomberg Media Studio operations from London into Dubai,” said Stephen Colvin, global chief commercial officer, Bloomberg Media. He added that the creation of this studio is an “important addition” to Bloomberg’s other studios in New York, London and Singapore. “It will allow us to successfully fulfill the demand for our unique data-driven and purpose-focused brand storytelling,” said Colvin. Bloomberg Media Studios’ global revenue grew 50 percent year-over-year from 2020 to 2021, according to a company statement. Its roster of clients also doubled during this period in the Middle East and Africa region. “Our new studio in the UAE will be a place to enhance our collaborations with the Middle East and Africa’s most ambitious companies to deliver high-quality content that reaches a global, influential audience,” said Ashish Verma, global head of Bloomberg Media Studios. The move is part of Bloomberg’s ongoing media expansion in the region, which includes localized platforms, content, regional talent and the launch of its flagship morning show “Bloomberg Daybreak: Middle East.”
