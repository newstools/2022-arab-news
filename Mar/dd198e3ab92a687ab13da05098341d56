KYIV: A Russian journalist for the investigative news outlet The Insider was killed when Russian troops shelled a residential neighborhood in the Ukrainian capital, the outlet said Wednesday.
Oksana Baulina, who previously also worked for Russian opposition leader Navalny’s anti-corruption group, “died under fire in Kyiv” while “filming the destruction” caused by Russian shelling, The Insider said on its website.
Another civilian was killed alongside Baulina in the strike and two other people were wounded, it added.
Baulina had worked for Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation until it was declared an extremist organization last year.
That prompted her to leave the country and continue reporting on corruption in Russia for The Insider, the news outlet said.
After Russia invaded Ukraine a month ago, Baulina filed several reports from Kyiv and Lviv in western Ukraine for the outlet.
“The Insider expresses its deepest condolences to Oksana’s family and friends,” it said.
Sergiy Tomilenko, head of the Ukranian journalists’ union, confirmed the death in a statement on Facebook, saying that Baulina was reporting on the aftermath of a shelling when she was hitting by fresh fire.
Earlier Wednesday, Tomilenko group said a cameraman for a local television station in the besieged southern city of Mariupol had also died.
