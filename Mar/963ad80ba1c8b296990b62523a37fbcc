ROME: Italy’s ambassador in Abu Dhabi has praised the UAE for its “outstanding” commitment in the reduction of CO2 emissions. Speaking at a debate on “the global need to save energy” organized by the Italian Trade Commission at the Italian pavilion of Expo 2020 Dubai, Nicola Lener said “huge investments are planned” in the UAE to reduce polluting emissions and increase production of clean energy. This “positive and consolidated attitude” opens the way to “many opportunities for greater cooperation with international investors and partners, including Italian firms, which can provide state-of-the-art and innovative technologies,” he added. Lener explained to the audience the UAE’s goal of achieving 50 percent clean energy supply and reducing its carbon footprint by 70 percent by 2050. The audience included Emirati and Italian players in the field of environmental defense and clean energy production, such as Enel. “We aim to present all the Italian innovations applied to the energy sector,” said Amedeo Scarpa, director of the commission in Dubai.
