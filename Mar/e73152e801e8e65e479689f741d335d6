AMMAN: Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah, supervisor general of the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center, signed two agreements to provide food security and housing support to Syrian and Palestinian refugees in Jordan. The first agreement was signed with the National Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition amounting to $2 million to boost food security for poor families. Through the project, the center will provide the alliance with a donation to secure the food needs of the Syrian and Palestinian refugees for six months in all the Jordanian governorates. This will be achieved through the distribution of magnetic cards every two months to the beneficiaries, who can use the cards in affiliated supermarkets outside the camps. The number of individuals benefiting from this project amounts to 28,865. The second agreement was signed with the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organization to provide housing support, to pay water and electricity bills and to cover the rent of the Syrian families with disabilities in the governorate of Irbid in Jordan for three years. The agreement will benefit 22 Syrian families, with 109 individuals. Al-Rabeeah said that KSrelief, the humanitarian arm of the Kingdom, is the only authority delivering official Saudi aid outside to help conflict-ridden peoples. The center carries out this activity in fulfillment of the Kingdom’s goals as part of its leading role in humanitarian and relief work.
