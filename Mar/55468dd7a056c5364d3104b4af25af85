RIYADH: The head of the Diriyah Gate Development Authority said a new agreement signed with King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology opens the doors on a world that has remained buried for centuries. Jerry Inzerillo, the CEO of DGDA, said that the exploration of buried and subterranean areas within DGDA’s supervisory area could help expand and improve our understanding of different aspects of the area. He was speaking after signing the agreement with Dr. Munir Eldesouki, President of KACST. As part of the agreement, DGDA and KACST will cooperate on aerial photography, three-dimensional (3D) imaging and radar scanning efforts, focusing specifically on artifacts of the early Saudi states. The agreement will also involve collaboration in advanced material technologies and automated building systems to support DGDA in managing its supervisory area. According to Inzerillo, this agreement is especially important given DGDA’s mandate and focus on not only improving the quality of life for citizens, residents and visitors today and in the future, but also preserving the history, heritage and culture of Diriyah. Eldesouki stressed that KACST actively builds partnerships with the public, private and non-profit sectors to ensure the application of scientific and technical outputs and achieve the leadership's aspirations in the transformation of an innovation-based economy, to serve the development projects and work that the DGDA is undertaking, in a way that contributes to preserving the historical and cultural heritage of Diriyah and applying higher sustainability standards in light of the Kingdom’s 2030 Vision.
