LONDON: Saudi Arabia could host the Oleksandr Usyk vs. Anthony Joshua rematch in late June, according to Ukrainian promoter Alexander Krassyuk. Ukrainian Usyk is set to face Anthony Joshua after beating the Brit last year for the title of unified heavyweight champion. Their much-awaited rematch could take place in Saudi Arabia. “Saudi is the place we are in discussions with at the moment,” Krassyuk told BBC Sport. “Late June is the date we are looking at. Nothing has been confirmed on paper. We are working on it.” Saudi Arabia is believed to be the front-runner, but Krassyuk has not ruled out the rematch taking place elsewhere. “There are other options, but we take it step by step,” he added. Saudi Arabia has been investing heavily in its sporting and entertainment industries, and has hosted a series of high profile sport events in recent years, including boxing matches. Joshua, 32, could return to Saudi Arabia having regained his world title belts by beating Mexican Andy Ruiz Jr. in Riyadh in December 2019, after being knocked out by the Mexican in a shock knockout defeat six months earlier. The fight had originally been billed for May, but was pushed back to allow Usyk, 35, to fight for the Ukraine army against Russian forces in the country. Usyk left Ukraine on March 23, and confirmed two days later that he had begun to prepare for his fight with Joshua.
