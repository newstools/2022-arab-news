RIYADH: Saudi Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture Abdul Rahman Al-Fadhli, who is also the chairman of the board of directors of the National Center for Vegetation Cover and Combating Desertification, attended the launching of the first workshop to study the Saudi Green Initiative afforestation plan on Sunday. The project aims to study the reality and future of afforestation in Saudi Arabia to reach the target set by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to plant 10 billion trees in the Kingdom, or the equivalent of rehabilitating 40 million hectares, during the coming decades to achieve sustainable vegetation. Khaled Al-Abulqader, CEO of the center, said that the workshop aimed at collecting information, exchanging experiences, coordinating efforts and activating partnerships between the various parties participating in the project. These workshops will be devoted to the public and private sectors, the nonprofit sector, in addition to the financial, academic and research sectors. Al-Abulqader said that the project seeks to increase the green areas through three important indicators: Local trees that are planted in various environments, sustaining already planted trees, and trees and plants that grow naturally after providing protection and care elements. The inspector general for forests and secretary of the Pakistani Ministry of Climate Change, Joudat Ayaz, delivered a presentation on ways to implement the Pakistani experiment and the challenges facing the “10 billion tree tsunami” program that is being implemented by the Pakistani government. The Saudi Green Initiative and the Middle East Green Initiative aim to plant 50 billion trees in total across the region and reduce carbon emissions by more than 10 percent of global contributions. They come as part of the Kingdom’s endeavors to strengthen regional and international partnerships to overcome environmental challenges, protect the planet and combat climate change.
