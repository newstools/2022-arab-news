‘Untitled’ (2021) For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle  In his latest series of works, Syrian artist Tammam Azzam incorporates a new practice: Paper collage. “His fragmented compositions highlight the physical remnants of conflict and showcase the importance of rebuilding and creating from destruction,” his gallery’s notes say of this series. ‘Untitled’ (2022)  Azzam — who was born in Damascus in 1980 — has focused much of his work on the conflict in his homeland since leaving, first to Dubai and then to Berlin, where he currently lives and works. This series is no exception. His gallery describes it as “a look at the memory of war.” ‘Untitled’ (2022)  Azzam first came to international attention — along with several of his compatriots — during the Syrian Civil War. But, as he told Aesthetic Magazine in 2014, “I am not a political protestor. I am an artist who can work from any place, within any conditions, to produce art of freedom.”
