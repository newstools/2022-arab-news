Following her return to WWE at the start of 2022, Ronda Rousey has picked up where she left off, taking victories at Royal Rumble and Elimination Chamber in Saudi Arabia on her journey towards her title match with Charlotte Flair at WrestleMania 38 on April 2. In her first appearance since her defeat to Becky Lynch at WrestleMania 35, where she walked away with her first loss in the WWE, Rousey made a shock return to the ring as a late entrant to the 2022 Royal Rumble, eliminating the current SmackDown Women’s Champion Charlotte Flair and claiming her title shot against The Queen. Flair, the woman with the most title victories in SmackDown history, will be looking to reverse the recent run of results in matches against Rousey to retain her crown as SmackDown Women’s Champion, despite poor results against Rousey dating back to 2018. This, as well as her tag team defeat with Sonya Deville to Rousey and her partner Naomi at Elimination Chamber in Jeddah, should provide enough motivation for Flair to hold off The Baddest Woman on the Planet and retain her title at WrestleMania 38. This year’s WrestleMania 38 will feature the “Most Stupendous Two-Night WrestleMania in WWE History,” with all the action kicking off on Saturday, April 2 at the AT&T Stadium in Dallas, Texas continuing into Sunday, April 3 with the final match between Roman Reigns and Brock Lesnar set to cap off a major moment in the history of the sport.
