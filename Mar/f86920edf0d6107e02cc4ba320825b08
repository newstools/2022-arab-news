RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s General Directorate of Passports announced on Thursday it was extending visas for Ukrainians in the Kingdom, whether they are tourists or there for business, without fees or fines, for humanitarian considerations.
The decision was based on directives from King Salman, the authority said.
It added that the extension will be automatic, in cooperation with the National Information Center, without the need to visit the headquarters of the passport departments.
