RIYADH: Riyadh Season has started welcoming non-masked visitors at full capacity after previously receiving limited numbers due to precautionary COVID-19 measures, organizers said. Visitors can attend with no need to wear masks in all open areas, in compliance with a recent statement by the Ministry of Interior, lifting the measures for combating the pandemic in the Kingdom. The new development comes days before the start of the second academic semester vacation in Saudi Arabia, expected to prompt increased attendance at Riyadh Season’s various recreational activities and events.
