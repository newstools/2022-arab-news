DUBAI: World Wrestling Entertainment and MBC Group have signed a new partnership deal that makes streaming service Shahid the home of WWE in the Middle East and North Africa region. The agreement includes all WWE premium live events, beginning with WrestleMania 38 on April 3 and 4, as well as live episodes of TV shows “Raw” and “SmackDown.” WWE Network’s entire library of original programming and archived content will also be available on Shahid as part of the deal. In addition to the streaming services, the MBC Action TV channel will broadcast one-hour highlight editions of “Raw” and “SmackDown” each week, as well the shows “Afterburn” and “Main Event.” “MBC Group is a market leader in the region and a great partner for WWE,” said Nick Khan, the president of WWE, who added that he believes the content and partnership will expand its reach in the region. Natasha Hemingway, Shahid’s chief commercial and marketing officer, said: “It’s no secret that WWE is massively popular in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the MENA region. This new partnership is sure to be incredibly exciting for fans, and with more and more live sporting events — including WWE — coming to the Kingdom, we cannot wait to see where this partnership takes us.” Shahid will offer a dedicated WWE streaming channel featuring the entire WWE Network archive, which includes more than 10,000 hours of content. In addition the TV show “NXT” will be available a day after its initial US broadcast. From March 26, Shahid will air “SmackDown” live on Saturdays at 4 a.m. KSA time in Arabic, with a one-hour version broadcast with Arabic subtitles on MBC Action at 9 p.m. the same day. Beginning on March 29, Shahid will show “Raw” live on Tuesdays at 4 a.m. KSA time in Arabic, followed by a one-hour edition with Arabic subtitles on MBC Action at 9 p.m.
