NEWCASTLE: Eddie Howe and his Newcastle United squad will this weekend be heading to Dubai for a warm-weather training camp following their Premier League trip to struggling Everton, according to reports from the UK on Monday. After the trip to Goodison Park on Thursday night, the Magpies will not have another Premier League fixture until April 3, when they travel to London for a clash with Tottenham Hotspur. The club’s trip to the UAE, where they will be staying at Nad Al-Sheba Sports Complex, will be the second trip to the Gulf after the recent visit to Jeddah, during which the first team took part in a training match against Saudi Pro League leaders Al-Ittihad and senior players put on training sessions for youngsters at Mahd Academy. The week-long break in Saudi Arabia came at the end of January following what has turned out to be the club’s turning point of the season, a 1-0 win against Leeds United at Elland Road. Since then, Newcastle have eased themselves away from the relegation zone with an eight-match unbeaten run, which came to an end in controversial manner with a 1-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge at the weekend. Howe’s team now have 31 points from 28 matches and are nine points clear of the relegation places with 10 matches remaining. Nad Al-Sheba Sports Complex, which is owned by Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, has over the years been favored for athletes hoping to train with a measure of privacy and for those undergoing rehabilitation after long-term injuries. Howe will be hoping that the latest trip will have the same effect as the last one, with the club in sight of Premier League safety on returning to the UK.
