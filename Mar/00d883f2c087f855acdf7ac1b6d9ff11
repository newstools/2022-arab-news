AMMAN: The Supervisor General of the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center, Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah, has met previously conjoined twins Mohammed and Amjad 12 years after they were successfully separated in an operation at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh.
Al-Rabeeah met the twins at their family home in the Jordanian capital Amman.
The twins’ connected lower back, abdomen, liver and intestines were separated by a specialist Saudi medical team in 2010.
Al-Rabeeah said that the twins’ separation program comes under the directives of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to provide medical aid for any who need it, adding that the program will continue to provide treatment and care for twins around the world.
The twins’ parents thanked the Kingdom for the medical assistance that led to their sons’ recovery.   During his visit to the Zaatari camp in Jordan on Thursday, Al-Rabeeah said that KSrelief will continue to support refugees from Syria so that they can improve their standard of living.
Since its inception in May 2015, KSrelief has implemented 1,919 projects worth over $5.6 billion in 79 countries. The initiatives were carried out in cooperation with 144 local, regional and international partners. According to a recent report, the countries and territories that benefited the most from the center’s various projects were Yemen ($4 billion), Palestine ($368 million), Syria ($325 million) and Somalia ($210 million).
