Rock art in Ghada, Unaizah governorate, has always attracted local residents as a tourist destination. It is located amid golden sands within Ghada Park on the southwestern side of the governorate, about 21 kilometers away on the so-called Dhala Road.
Explorers have discovered that the rock art, which is featured on rectangular black mound about one kilometer long extending from east to west, dates back to the ancient period. It includes both animal and human elements. Petrified wood was also used for carving, and explorers have found part of a column one meter long with a 42-centimeter diameter.
The site of the rock art is protected by a fence under the permanent control of the Heritage Authority.
The authority said that the site in Ghada Park is an “archaeological spatial memory of ancient civilizations” that documented their history and experiences in the Arabian Peninsula.
