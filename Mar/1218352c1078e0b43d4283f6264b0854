DUBAI: The construction of Ciel Tower, expected to be the world’s tallest hotel, has been half completed. The 365-meters building has reached the halfway stage of 52 storeys, according to the skyscraper’s developer The First Group. The Dubai-based developer said that the construction works are proceeding smoothly in a bid tp meet its scheduled completion date in the fourth quarter of 2023. The grand opening of the hotel is scheduled for the first half of 2024. “Despite the broader challenges presented by COVID-19 to the construction sector over the past two years, work on Ciel has continued unabated throughout the pandemic, a feat that is testament to the commitment and dedication of the project’s design and construction teams,” said The First Group in a statement. Upon completion, Ciel Tower will surpass Dubai's 356-meter Gevora Hotel, which is now considered the world's tallest hotel. Ciel Tower is designed by architectural company NORR, and it is being built by The First Group’s chief development partner, China Railway Construction Corporation. “Ciel will set a new benchmark for innovative design in super-tall buildings, not just in Dubai, but globally. We are very fortunate to have had Yahya Yan, the visionary president of NORR, lead our design team on this flagship project. Ciel is truly an exciting addition to the famous Dubai Marina skyline,” said Danny Lubert, co-founder of The First Group.
