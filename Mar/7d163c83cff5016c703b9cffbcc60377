DUBAI: Emirates SkyCargo will be reactivating its cargo hub in Dubai South, Emirates SkyCentral DWC, for dedicated freighter aircraft operations from March 26 in response to growing post-pandemic demand. The move to reinstate operation at SkyCentral DWC will mark a return to dual hub cargo operations in Dubai for the air cargo carrier after a period of nearly two years. In 2020, Emirates SkyCargo had consolidated its freighter and passenger-cargo operations at Dubai International Airport, following the suspension of passenger flights due to the outbreak of COVID-19. As the pandemic has now slowed down, passenger numbers and cargo volumes have increased, and it has made Emirates SkyCargo restructure its operations across two hubs in Dubai. According to a company statement, Emirates SkyCentral DXB will handle cargo arriving or departing on passenger aircraft while Emirates SkyCentral DWC will handle cargo on freighter aircraft.
