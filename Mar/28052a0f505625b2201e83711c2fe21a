CAIRO: Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said his country’s participation in Monday’s Negev Summit was aimed at “strengthening the (Israeli-Palestinian) peace process.” The summit, hosted by Israel, included the foreign ministers of the US, the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt and Morocco. “The resumption of negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel was a significantly discussed issue … and our participation in the summit came to consolidate peace, present our viewpoint, and push for the continuation of peace efforts,” said Shoukry. “Our region faces several challenges related to terrorism and extremism, and we are cooperating to achieve stability.” He described the Egyptian-Israeli peace deal signed 43 years ago as “fruitful and shows the importance of stability in the region.” Shoukry stressed the “importance of the two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians on the basis of the 1967 borders.”
