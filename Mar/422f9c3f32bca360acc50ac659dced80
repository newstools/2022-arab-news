DUBAI: Broadcaster OSN has signed an agreement with content and distribution company All3Media International. As part of the deal, OSN began streaming the six-part miniseries “The Tourist,” a drama starring Jamie Dornan as a man who wakes up in the Australian Outback with no memory of his past, on the same day as it launched in the US on HBO Max. The new shows included in the deal also include “Trigger Point,” a six-part thriller about bomb-disposal experts working in London, which is executive produced by Jed Mercurio, the creator of “Line of Duty.” “OSN provides the perfect home in the UAE for star-studded content and drama with strong dynamic narratives,” said Kelly Shek, sales manager for Africa, the Middle East, Turkey and Israel at All3Media International. Nick Forward, OSN’s managing director of streaming and chief content officer, added: “At OSN, we are always looking for the very best programming to meet the demands of a diverse audience in this region. All3Media International is one of the world’s leading distributors of premium scripted content and we are delighted to bring some of their biggest and best shows to OSN subscribers in 2022.” OSN has partnerships with a number of major studios including HBO, NBC Universal, ViacomCBS, Paramount, and MGM. This year it signed a content agreement with Endeavor Content and added new NBCUniversal titles.
