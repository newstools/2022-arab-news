JEDDAH: Saudi Arabia has advanced one position to place 25th in this year’s World Happiness Report. The survey, published by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, measures happiness levels in 156 countries around the world. Last year, the Kingdom placed 26th. It has measured the Kingdom’s progress since 2017, highlighting the influence of Saudi Vision 2030’s goals, including the development of the Quality of Life Program. It noted that the Kingdom has excelled in improving gross domestic product, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life decisions, as well as ramping up efforts to confront corruption. The Kingdom has established social support projects and economic programs that contribute to the country’s recovery from the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, the report said. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the World Happiness Report, which uses global survey data to report changes in the lives of the public around the world. “The report has been based on two key ideas: That happiness or life evaluation can be measured through opinion surveys, and that we can identify key determinants of well-being and thereby explain the patterns of life evaluation across countries,” the report’s website says. It added that the results of surveys can help countries craft policies aimed at achieving happier societies.
