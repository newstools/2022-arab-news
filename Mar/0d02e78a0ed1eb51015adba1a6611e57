DUBAI: Metaverse Fashion Week is the first-ever virtual design event that will take place in the digital sphere from March 24 to 27, with over 50 internationally renowned creators, including Lebanese fashion house Elie Saab, Italian luxury maison Dolce & Gabbana and US heritage label Tommy Hilfiger. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle Similar to the traditional fashion weeks that take place all over the world, MVFW will allow designers to showcase their latest collections on avatar models, while also providing a platform for brands that exist solely in the virtual sphere. The fashion week will be held in Decentraland, which is a 3D virtual world that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Users of the browser-based platform can interact, explore, buy and sell real estate, and play games. There is a free sign up to attend any of the MVFW events, however an Ethereum wallet is necessary for purchases. Speaking of purchases, Boson Portal–Fashion District, which is a digital retail space in Decentraland, was created as a luxury shopping area mimicking the renowned Avenue Montaigne in Paris. Each brand will sell their exclusive physical products as redeemable non-fungible tokens within a boulevard of metaverse stores. Meanwhile, London’s iconic retailer Selfridges will celebrate the launch of its first digital flagship in the metaverse. In addition to runway shows and shopping opportunities, the inaugural MVFW will also host a string of concerts. Digital fashion house Auroboros is scheduled to host an immersive experience with a unique performance spearheaded by Canadian singer Grimes. There will also be after-parties, panels, film screenings and discussions.
