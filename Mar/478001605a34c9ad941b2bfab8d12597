Gulf stocks will continue to outperform international share markets in 2022 with an inflow of $82 billion in foreign money, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. According to a team of Morgan Stanley analysts and strategists, flows are set to pick up as global emerging-market funds increase their exposure to the Middle East region. Analysts noted that shares listed in the Persian Gulf have increased this year, and they named Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait among those countries that will perform well this year in the region. Analysts also added that the financial sector of Qatar will benefit from a tight oil market and the 2022 Fifa World Cup.
