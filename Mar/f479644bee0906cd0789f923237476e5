RIYADH: The EU said that it “strongly condemns” recent attacks on civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia by Yemen’s Houthi militia.
The EU said the attacks are “completely unacceptable and must stop,” in a statement on Monday.
On Saturday night and Sunday, the Iran-backed militia fired a barrage of missiles and drones strikes targeting a Saudi petroleum products distribution terminal in the southern Jizan region, a water desalination plant in Al-Shaqeeq, a power station in Dhahran Al-Janub, a gas station in Khamis Mushayt and an LNG facility in the Red Sea port of Yanbu. The EU urged all parties in Yemen to work with “UN Special Envoy Hans Grundberg to achieve a comprehensive political agreement,” the statement said, indicating that it remains the only option to end the seven-year war.
The militia’s actions have been widely condemned for their danger to civilians, regional security and the stability of global energy markets. Saudi Arabia said on Monday that it could not be held responsible for any oil supply shortage to the international market that results from attacks on its facilities.
“The Kingdom stresses the importance of the international community to realize the gravity of Iran’s continued behavior of equipping the terrorist Houthi militias with ballistic missiles technology, and advanced UAVs with which they target the Kingdom’s oil, gas and refined products production sites,” a statement said.
Benchmark Brent crude oil stood at over $117 a barrel in trading early Tuesday.
The Houthi attacks came just as a meeting in Oman was convened by Grundberg with Houthi chief negotiator Mohammad Abdulsalam and Omani officials as part of the envoy’s efforts to address the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen, including a possible truce during the upcoming Holy month of Ramadan.
