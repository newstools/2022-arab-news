NEWCASTLE: Newcastle United head coach Eddie Howe has confirmed the Magpies will head to Dubai for another Middle East warm weather training camp this week. United are expected to head to Dubai’s Nad Al Sheba Sports Complex after Thursday evening’s Premier League encounter with Everton. The Magpies have a two-week break in between fixtures, as the scheduled weekend clash with Crystal Palace was postponed due to the Eagles’ continued presence in the FA Cup. And Howe has underlined the importance of another “team bonding” exercise, having traveled to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in January. Confirming the news, Howe said: “(The) plan is to try and not recreate exactly what we did, but the time is almost exactly the same between games so we want to try and mirror that as much as we can. “We played two games — one in the training ground and one in Saudi. We utilized various techniques with a little bit of rest and a lot of hard work as well, and we came back and went on a good run, so we’ll be looking to do the same again.” Warm weather training camps have been a rarity at Newcastle in recent years, but under the majority ownership of PIF, Howe has been afforded two in less than three months — and much of that is testament to his success. Heading to Goodison Park this week, Newcastle have lost just once since mid-December — a run which has taken them nine points clear of the Premier League relegation zone. “It’s hugely important as it’s a long, long season,” said Howe of the trip to Dubai. “And a long season at the same place can sometimes leave you a little bit stale. “We felt it was a good time to freshen things up for the group in a different environment. Forced time together does create new friendships and form the spirit you need for a relegation battle, and still need. “It’s something I’ve always done throughout my management career and it’s always had positive results.”
