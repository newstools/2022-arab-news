CAIRO: The Egyptian military has issued a statement expressing its “great sadness” over the killing of two of its soldiers who were part of the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali. Four others were wounded when a logistical convoy was hit by an improvised explosive device, said Olivier Salgado, spokesman for the UN mission. Egypt’s armed forces said they “extend their sincere condolences and sympathy, praying to God Almighty to bestow mercy and forgiveness on the martyrs, and to give their families patience and solace, with our sincere wishes for a speedy recovery for the injured. “The armed forces affirm that their role in maintaining international peace and security stems from its full belief in the importance of peace and coexistence and the eradication of terrorism under the umbrella of the United Nations.” The UN offered its condolences to Egypt’s government, as well as to the families and colleagues of the deceased, and wished a speedy recovery to the injured. The UN mission warned that attacks targeting its peacekeepers may constitute war crimes under international law. The French military announced on Monday the killing of a senior Al-Qaeda official in Mali in late February. The UN force is studying the impact of the withdrawal of France and its European partners from Mali, which was announced in February.
