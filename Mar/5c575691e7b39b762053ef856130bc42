RIYADH: The King Fahd National Library in Riyadh is hosting Tiara Dream, Maison Chaumet’s first patrimonial exhibition in the Middle East. As the name suggests, the exhibition focuses on the tiara, the emblem of the French Jewelry house. It showcases exceptional examples of Chaumet tiaras dating from 1780 to more recent designs. Some of the exhibits once belonged to Empress Josephine, the wife of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. It also explores the cultural connections between French craftsmanship and the cultural heritage of Saudi Arabia by including Najdi designs on the tiara platforms, as part of a new initiative to build cultural bridges between the two countries through art and beauty. It considers Napoleon’s sword and then highlights the symbolism of the sword in Saudi culture, for example, and explores the vision of heaven as a common source of inspiration for the beauty encapsulated by jewelry as well as in Saudi literature and poetry. Organizers said the King Fahd National Library was chosen to host the exhibition, which continues until March 26, because it represents a historical and civilized symbol of development in Riyadh.
