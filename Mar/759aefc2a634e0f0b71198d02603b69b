During his acceptance speech at Hollywood’s Dolby Theater, Ahmed talked about the importance of togetherness during “such divided times” and dedicated his accolade to everyone “who feels like they don’t belong.” He said: “We believe that the role of story is to remind us there is no ‘us’ and ‘them.’ There’s just ‘us.’  This is for everyone who feels like they don’t belong. Anyone who feels like they’re stuck in no man’s land. You’re not alone. We’ll meet you there. That’s where the future is.” Ahmed, who is a Briton of Pakistani descent, co-wrote “The Long Goodbye” along with Karia. The short film follows a South Asian family from the suburbs of England preparing for a wedding before their lives are violently interrupted by masked militants. Ahmed made history last year as the first Muslim nominated for best actor in a leading role for “The Sound of Metal,” in which he played a drummer losing his hearing.
