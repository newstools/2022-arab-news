DAMMAM: A Syrian citizen in Eastern Province has been arrested after being found in possession of 35,400 amphetamine tablets.
A spokesman for the General Directorate of Narcotics Control said the arrest came after an investigation into drug smuggling and that the case had been passed to the general prosecutor.
Earlier, the authority reported that it seized more than 37,000 kilograms of illegal drugs in 2021, in addition to 190 million highly addictive Captagon pills.
The authority aims to protect Saudi society, support the national economy and improve international trade. The smuggling of Captagon pills, narcotics, counterfeit products and other contraband threatens the security and safety of Saudi society, and poses a major threat to the growth of the economy, the authority said.
Hashish, heroin, cocaine and khat are among the most common illegal substances smuggled into the Kingdom.
