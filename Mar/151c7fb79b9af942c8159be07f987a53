RIYADH: The average price of gasoline in the U.S. hit a record $4.17 per gallon on Tuesday as the country banned Russian oil imports after its invasion of Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a US ban on Russian oil and other energy imports, ramping up a pressure campaign on Moscow in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine. The US House of Representatives Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said that a House vote on a bill banning imports of Russian oil and other energy sources could come as soon as Tuesday. Good news. After sending Putin millions for oil, Biden has been shamed into doing the right thing. Now, Biden needs to reverse his ban on drilling leases to reduce the pain Americans feel at the pump. — Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) March 8, 2022
