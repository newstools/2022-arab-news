LONDON: Egyptian footballer Mohamed Salah endured racist abuse after he missed a crucial penalty during Egypt’s World Cup playoff loss to Senegal, it has been claimed. The Egyptian Football Association has accused Senegal’s fans of the discriminatory behavior toward the Liverpool superstar and his teammates. Salah and his fellow players also had lasers shone into their eyes during the match. Senegal qualified for the 2022 World Cup on penalties with another Liverpool player, Sadio Mane, scoring the vital goal, but FIFA has faced criticism for allowing the game to go ahead. Salah, a prolific goalscorer, blazed the ball over the bar after dozens of lasers targeted his eyes as he prepared to take the kick. Since the conclusion of the deciding tie, the Egyptian FA has published a statement alleging that Senegal fans targeted its players — especially Salah — by throwing bottles and rocks at them during the warm-up. It alleged that the Senegalese targeted the team bus as it approached the stadium, with windows smashed after objects were thrown. The EFA published a photo on its Instagram account which it claimed was a fan holding a sign with abuse aimed at Salah. It said it has submitted an official complaint against its counterpart. “The Egyptian group’s buses have also been exposed to assaults that led to broken windows and injuries; filed with pictures and videos as proof in the complaint submitted,” the association said.
