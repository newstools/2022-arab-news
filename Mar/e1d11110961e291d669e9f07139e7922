BERLIN: Bayer Leverkusen exposed Bayern Munich’s defensive frailties but were unable to get more than a 1-1 draw from their Bundesliga encounter on Saturday, when Hertha Berlin took another step toward relegation.
Bayern dropped points for the second time in four league games and posed more questions than answers ahead of their Champions League round of 16 second leg against Salzburg on Wednesday.
Bayern only drew the first leg 1-1.
Bayern ‘keeper Sven Ulreich prevented worse against Leverkusen, though his team made the better start.
Niklas Süle, whose performances had been coming under extra scrutiny since his announced end-of-season switch to Borussia Dortmund, fired Bayern ahead in the 18th minute after Leverkusen failed to properly clear a corner.
Leverkusen equalized in the 36th when Bayern captain Thomas Müller directed Kerem Demirbay’s harmless-looking cross past his own goalkeeper.
Hertha’s inexorable slide toward relegation continued with a 4-1 loss at home to Eintracht Frankfurt – a team that had lost their last three games.
Hertha had been hoping to challenge for European qualification ever since billionaire Lars Windhorst first invested in the club in 2019, but Tayfun Korkut’s team have yet to win a game this year. Hertha occupies the Bundesliga relegation playoff place with nine rounds remaining.
Leipzig scored late to draw with Freiburg 1-1, Wolfsburg defeated Union Berlin 1-0, and Bochum enjoyed a 2-1 win over last-placed Greuther Fürth.
Stuttgart hosted Borussia Mönchengladbach late.
