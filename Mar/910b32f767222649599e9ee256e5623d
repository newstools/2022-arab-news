CAIRO: Egyptian Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mohammed Abdel-Aty and his South Sudanese counterpart Manawa Peter, who is currently visiting Cairo, discussed issues of common interest and ways to enhance bilateral relations. Among the topics of discussion was the status of projects in South Sudan to provide drinking water and protection against floods. Abdel-Aty said that Egypt was implementing the projects requested by South Sudan, citing the history of cooperation between the two countries, during which several development initiatives benefitting the South Sudanese people have been implemented. He explained that the ministry has established six underground wells, while seven underground drinking water stations equipped with solar energy in and around vital areas of South Sudan’s capital, Juba, are currently being constructed to provide clean drinking water to residents. A lifting unit, the minister added, was installed to transfer river water to population centers near the waterways in the city of Wau in South Sudan to provide clean drinking water for citizens, and river sidewalks connecting the main cities and villages of the country were constructed. A project to purify waterways in the Bahr Al-Ghazal basin was also implemented. The minister referenced a number of other initiatives aimed at benefitting South Sudan, including the protection of villages and agricultural lands from high water levels and the establishment of a water quality analysis laboratory, which is currently carrying out analyses for government agencies in the country. Abdel-Aty added that a joint memorandum of understanding had been signed between the two countries to realize a project to reduce flood risks in the Bahr Al-Jabal basin. The South Sudanese minister expressed his hope in achieving increased cooperation between the two countries in the field of water management.
