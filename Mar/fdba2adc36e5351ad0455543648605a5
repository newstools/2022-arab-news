CAIRO: The Egyptian government has condemned the Houthis’ attack on economic and civilian facilities in Saudi Arabia, describing the actions as flouting international law. In a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Egypt slammed “in the strongest terms, the Houthi militia’s continuation of its despicable terrorist attacks (on) the territory of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the latest of which was (on) economic and civil(ian) facilities at dawn on Sunday, with drones and ballistic missiles.” The statement stressed that this was a “great escalation” and violated international law. Egypt reaffirmed its support for the Kingdom. The attacks took place on Saturday night and in the early hours of Sunday morning. The Houthi actions come ahead of GCC-sponsored peace talks between Yemeni factions that the militia said they would not attend. The talks are due to take place from March 29 in Riyadh.
