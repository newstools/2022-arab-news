IMCTC secretary-general Maj. Gen. Pilot Mohammed bin Saeed Al-Moghedi said the program would also explore the development of terrorism in recent years and its most prominent trends. The role of strategic approaches to combating terrorism, their application, and their effectiveness in confronting contemporary threats were also discussed during the session. Al-Moghedi said the program provided practical training for participants on effective means and techniques used to combat terrorism, including means of detecting and cutting off terrorist financing, best practices for coordination between government agencies, and the dissemination of anti-terrorism messages.
