LONDON: The man accused of killing British MP David Amess last year told police he had committed a “terror” crime, a court has heard. Ali Harbi Ali, 26, is currently facing prosecution for murder and preparing acts of terrorism for his alleged role in the fatal stabbing of Amess. He has denied the charges. Footage from body cameras worn by police during Ali’s arrest was shown to jurors. Two police officers, armed only with a baton and a pepper spray-like substance, are recorded entering a church where Ali was said to be hiding, armed with a knife. One police officer, PC Ryan Curtis, said he found Ali standing in the aisle of the church with a blood-stained knife in his hand. He was told by Curtis and his colleague PC Scott James to “drop the knife.” Ali did so after a short standoff. Ali was recorded saying “I was prepared to die,” the court heard. He was taken to Southend Police Station and asked if the crime might be domestic or hate-related. Ali told the booking officer: “Terror. Religious,” the jury heard. Ali’s trial continues.
