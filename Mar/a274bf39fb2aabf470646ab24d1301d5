Clooney, who has four-year-old twins with her husband, told Time about how she balanced her family and career.  A post shared by TIME (@time) She said: “Marriage has been wonderful. I have in my husband a partner who is incredibly inspirational and supportive, and we have a home filled with love and laughter. It is a joy beyond anything I could ever have imagined. I feel so lucky to have found a great love in my life, and to be a mother — this is how I get my balance.” On her humanitarian work, she pointed out how she tried to turn the spotlight on what was important. “If I am at a work function and reporting of it focuses on irrelevant issues, there’s not much I can do about that. Since I can’t control it, my approach is just not to dwell on it and just get on with my work and my life and hope that attitudes will catch up,” she added.
