ISLAMABAD: Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Faisal bin Farhan met Thai Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai in Islamabad on Tuesday on the sidelines of an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation session. 
They reviewed bilateral relations and ways to reinforce them in all areas of cooperation, discussed the topics on the agenda for the 48th session of the OIC’s Council of Foreign Ministers and the latest regional and international developments, the Saudi Press Agency reported.
Saudi Arabia and Thailand restored full diplomatic ties earlier this year following Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha’s visit to Riyadh at the invitation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It was the first top leadership meeting between the two countries in more than three decades.

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan gave the keynote address.
