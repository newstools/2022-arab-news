Saudi Arabia was confirmed on Wednesday as the host of the 7th Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games, which will take place in 2025. It will be the first time the event has been held in the Kingdom. During a ceremony for the official signing of the agreement to host the Games, Prince Abdulaziz Bin Turki Al-Faisal, president of the Saudi Olympic and Paralympic Committee, thanked King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman for their unconditional support for all sports initiatives. He also highlighted the extent to which sport in Saudi Arabia has progressed globally in recent years, as evidenced by the country’s successful bids to host major events and competitions, including the 2034 Asian Games and the 2023 World Combat Games. He said that serving as host of the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games in 2025 is just the start of a journey for the Kingdom that will include the hosting of several Asian competitions. Prince Abdulaziz signed the official agreement to host the event alongside Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman, the deputy governor of Riyadh region, and Raja Randhir Singh, acting president of the Olympic Council of Asia, during a ceremony at Riyadh Green Halls in the Prince Faisal bin Fahad Olympic Complex. Prince Fahad Bin Jalawi, the vice president of the SOPC, and Hussain Al-Musallam, director-general of the OCA, were also present. Riyadh was announced as host of the 2025 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games during the 40th general assembly of the OCA, which took place in Dubai last November. The event was first held in Thailand in 2005, followed by Macau in 2007, Vietnam in 2009, South Korea in 2013 and Ashgabat in 2017. Next year, Thailand will host the sixth edition, which was delayed from 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
