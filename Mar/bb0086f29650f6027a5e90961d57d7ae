Islam Makhachev extended his unbeaten run in the UFC to 10 fights with the defeat of Bobby Green via a technical knockout in round one, and immediately turned his attention to a lightweight title shot in Abu Dhabi. Makhachev took a little over three and a half minutes to finish Green in their catchweight bout at UFC Fight Night: Makhachev vs. Green. Green took the fight on short notice after an injury to original opponent Beneil Dariush, and Dagestani Makhachev made quick work of his American opponent, overwhelming him on the ground before forcing the referee to step in after 3 minutes and 32 seconds. Coached by former lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, Makhachev now owns the joint-sixth-longest winning streak among active fighters in the UFC and has his eyes fixed on a title shot in the 155lb division. “I want to fight for the title in Abu Dhabi, where all my friends and fans can come and support me. I feel good,” Makhachev said. “I have no injuries or pain, so I am very happy. I am going to spend a little bit of time with my family, in the last 11 months I have fought four times. I have to spend some time with them.” “I am always in shape,” he said. “I am not like these fighters who fight and then rest for three or four months, I am going back to the gym on Monday because I am not injured and I have to improve.” Current champion Charles Oliveira will defend the lightweight title against Justin Gaethje in May, and Makhachev wants to face the winner. “Justin (Gaethje) is going to fight for the title with (Charles) Oliveira and I am going to be next. In 11 months, I have finished four guys and I deserve this.” Makhachev is no stranger to fighting in Abu Dhabi with two wins in the UAE capital to his name. In 2019 he scored a decision win over Davi Ramos, while last year he secured a statement win in stopping Dan Hooker in the first round.
