RIYADH: Saudi Arabia has in recent years pumped more than $19 billion into the international Yemeni aid program, the head of the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center has revealed. Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah, KSrelief’s general supervisor, said the money had been put toward humanitarian and economic development projects in the war-torn country. He was speaking during a virtual UN meeting, co-hosted by Sweden and Switzerland, aimed at rallying financial support for the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The event was also attended by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, President of the Swiss Confederation Ignazio Cassis, Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Anne Lindy, UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths, and Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to the UN in Geneva Dr. Abdulaziz Al-Wasel. On behalf of the Kingdom, Al-Rabeeah thanked the UN, Switzerland, and Sweden for organizing the donor conference, adding that Yemen was facing a major humanitarian crisis made worse by the “terrorist” actions of the Iran-backed Houthis that were threatening the security of neighboring countries. “This requires a firm stance from the international community to protect the brotherly Yemeni people and reach sustainable solutions that achieve security, stability, and development for Yemen and its people, the region, and the world. “Saudi Arabia appreciates the (UN) Security Council’s adoption of Resolution 2624 (2022), which classifies the Houthi group as a terrorist group,” he said. Al-Rabeeah pointed out that the Kingdom remained fully committed to supporting all efforts aimed at reaching a sustainable political solution to the situation in Yemen and ensuring the unity and safety of the country. He added that Saudi Arabia would continue to support Yemen through relief and humanitarian programs in coordination with international and local partners.
