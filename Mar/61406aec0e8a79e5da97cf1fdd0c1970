The Ukraine war influence Cryptocurrencies have played a crucial role in the war in Ukraine, helping the government raise millions of dollars to fight against Russian aggression. Ukrainian officials began posting addresses for two crypto wallets on their Twitter accounts at the beginning of the conflict, giving donors a clear and direct address to which to send contributions. Four days into the invasion, the wallets attracted more than $10.2 million. Over $100 million worth of crypto has been raised since then, with 60 percent of donations going to the “Crypto Fund for Ukraine” run by Michael Chobanian, founder of the Ukrainian crypto exchange Kuna.
