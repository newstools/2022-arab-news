RIYADH: Saudi Arabia has strongly condemned a missile attack that struck Iraq’s Kurdish regional capital Irbil on Sunday.
Iraqi state TV quoted the Kurdistan region's counter-terrorism force as saying 12 missiles launched from outside Iraq hit Irbil.
The missiles caused only material damage and one civilian was injured, the Kurdish interior ministry said. Iran's Revolutionary Guards later released a statement taking responsibility for the missile attacks against Israeli “strategic centres” in Irbil, Iran's state media reported.
The Kingdom’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirmed the solidarity of the Saudi government with Iraq and support for any measures that the country takes to protect its security and stability.
The ministry added that the Kingdom rejects all forms of violence, extremism, and terrorism.
