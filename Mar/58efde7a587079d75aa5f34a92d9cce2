RIYADH: In March last year, the Saudi Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development launched the “Improving Contractual Relationship” initiative to make work environments in the Kingdom more attractive, develop human competency and make the Saudi labor market more efficient. The initiative covers foreign workers in the private sector and helps to protect the rights of both parties. One year into the implementation of the initiative, more than 65,000 foreign employees have benefited from the reforms, including 10 different nationalities, with men forming 93 percent of those affected. Salaries of 65 percent of beneficiaries have increased due to the functional mobility service, and more than 30,000 commercial enterprises from all sectors have benefited, most notably the sectors of renovations of residential and nonresidential buildings, general residential construction, building maintenance service activities, equipment owners, transport drivers and restaurants. The initiative involves reforms in three key services related to employees: The functional mobility service, the development of the exit and re-entry procedures and practices, and the final exit procedures.
