RIYADH: Salwa Radwi is currently the CEO of Nuqtah NFT, Saudi’s first non-fungible token market. Crypto specialists define NFT as a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, and videos. They are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and generally encoded with the same underlying crypto software. Radwi spotted this opportunity and founded her company last year. Nuqtah allows artists to register and trace their artwork with full details available on a public ledger that cannot be manipulated. She describes it as “a place with a passion and vision to create a real community of art enthusiasts, blockchain advocates, and passionate individuals.” • CEO Salwa Radwi says they are ‘bringing NFTs to the Saudi region to breed a new line of art investors and enable creators toward the wildest opportunities.’ • According to industry reports, her company received pre-seed investment from venture capital firm Shorooq Partners. The startup will use the money to grow its network across the MENA region. • Before launching Nuqtah NFTs, Radwa worked with the Governorate of Jeddah for two years. She is also an alumna of Stanford University Graduate School of Business. “We are bringing NFTs to the Saudi region to breed a new line of art investors and enable creators toward the wildest opportunities,” said Radwi.
