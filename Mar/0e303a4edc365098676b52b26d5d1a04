DUBAI: Abu Dhabi Crown Prince, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, pushed for a peaceful resolution of the Russia-Ukraine conflict during a telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian leader discussed with Sheikh Mohamed the resulting crisis from the Russian military invasion, as well as the progress made in the ongoing peace negotiations. Russia and Ukraine are to resume peace talks online on April 1 after the latest round of face-to-face negotiations ended in Turkey. Sheikh Mohamed stressed the importance of finding peaceful solutions through dialogue to ensure ending the crisis and its fallout and bringing peace back to Ukraine. “We must prioritize ensuring the safety of civilians and enhancing efforts and coordination between countries and humanitarian organisations to provide assistance to affected Ukrainian citizens,” according to the Abu Dhabi leader, in a report from state news agency WAM. The UAE supports any measures taken to accelerate reaching a peaceful settlement of the crisis, through diplomatic means and peace talks, Sheikh Mohamed said. Zelensky thanked the UAE for its gesture of welcoming displaced Ukrainians into the Emirates, and also providing humanitarian aid since the crisis began.
