Saudi Arabia will no longer require travelers to undergo mandatory COVID-19 quarantine upon arrival in the Kingdom. Passengers will also no longer need to provide a PCR test upon their arrival.
All arrivals in the Kingdom on visit visas of any kind are required to get insurance that covers the costs of treatment from any coronavirus infection.
