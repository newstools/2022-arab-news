RIYADH: Saudi defenses have intercepted and destroyed a Houthi ballistic missile fired toward Jazan, the Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen said on Tuesday. The militia's escalation of its grave violations aims to thwart upcoming peace talks between Yemeni factions, the coalition said. The talks are due to start on March 29 and will take place in Riyadh.
