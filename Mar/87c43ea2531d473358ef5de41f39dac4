LONDON: RT France’s presenter bid farewell on Thursday to its European audience in its last news segment following the EU’s decision to ban it and Sputnik from broadcasting in Europe. Citing the decision as a threat to press freedom, RT’s presenter thanked those who have supported the channel.  “This is the last news segment broadcast by RT France after the EU’s decision to ban RT in Europe. We have worked with full transparency and professionalism and have listened and respected all opinions without prejudice,” said RT’s presenter. “We have given a voice to those that could not be heard in traditional media outlets to deliver full and rounded information. We have always respected the rules imposed on us and today we are targeted with an arbitrary decision, an unprecedented decision that is dangerous for freedom of press and freedom of expression,” she added. “Thank you to all those who work for RT France and to all the loyal audiences who have supported the channel.” The EU’s decision to ban Russian state-owned media outlets in Europe follows accusations of systematic disinformation perpetrated by the channels over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Systematic information manipulation and disinformation by the Kremlin is applied as an operational tool in its assault on Ukraine,” Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said in a statement. “It is also a significant and direct threat to the union’s public order and security.” The ban also applies to RT’s English unit and operations in the UK, Germany and Spain.
