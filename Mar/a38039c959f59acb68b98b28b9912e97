RIYADH: Food companies are facing rising production inputs amid the mounting tensions of Russia-Ukraine crisis, the chief executive officer of food and beverage business Agthia Group has told Al Arabiya, noting that it is hard to predict the conflict consequences. To tackle the rise in prices, the Abu Dhabi-listed company is currently working on three main measures, the first is an equation between raising prices and market share in order to grow, Ammar Al-Ghoul added. The second measure focuses on reducing costs, in order to absorb the increase in production inputs’ prices without it being reflected on the consumer. The third measure is the management of inventory and efficiency in procurement. Established in 2004, Agthia Group sells brands including Yoplait and Al-Ain.
