RIYADH: Tadawul is in advanced talks over at least two companies from the Gulf nations listing on Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange, according to its CEO. Khalid Alhussan said the move will enable the Tadawul Group to attract new investors and increase trading activity among institutional investors. The group also plans to offer new financial products and services to strengthen and improve competition in keeping with its strategy, the CEO told Argaam. Tadawul plans to introduce a product in the upcoming period and select eight to ten companies to begin offering the corporate futures, and the number will increase as market and investor needs dictate.
