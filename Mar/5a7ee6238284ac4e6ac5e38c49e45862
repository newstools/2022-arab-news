RIYADH: Saudi air defenses destroyed a Houthi drone targeting Jazan, the Coalition to Restore Legitimacy said on Wednesday. Shrapnel from the drone, launched from Yemen’s Hodeidah province, scattered over civilian objects but did not cause damage, the coalition said. The Houthi militia continues to carry out cross-border attacks.
