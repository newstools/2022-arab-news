RIYADH: Russia’s foreign currency and gold reserves have plunged by $38.8 billion since February, Bloomberg reported citing the central bank. As of March 25, the country’s stockpile declined to the lowest level since last August to reach $604.4 billion. The decline is attributed to the extended sanctions and the measures preventing the central bank from deploying its assets, which are compelled by the Russia-Ukraine war.
