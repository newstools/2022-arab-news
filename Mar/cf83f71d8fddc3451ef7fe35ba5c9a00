DUBAI: MBC Group is launching The Fananees NFT Genesis Collection, featuring its most popular cartoon characters as digital collectibles for non-fungible token buyers in the region. The collection includes seven cartoon characters from the “Fananees” TV series, with more than 200 attributes and varying levels of rarity. MBC will release 9,999 unique NFTs on the first day of Ramadan, with future collections also being released around the period in the coming years. “‘Fananees’ is one of the most successful and well-known animations in the Arab world, with some of the most recognizable characters. In this era of constant innovation, we want to be at the forefront of emerging opportunities in NFTs, blockchain, and the metaverse,” said Fadel Zahreddine, group director of emerging media at MBC Group, in a statement. The collection marks MBC’s first steps into the NFT space, and “will pave the way for MBC Group to expand its presence in the realm of digital IPs (intellectual properties),” Zahreddine added. The “Fananees” NFTs will be integrated into existing games, allowing users to connect their NFTs to their game accounts and change their avatars to their NFT image. “Fananees” NFT holders will also receive one percent of all revenue from primary and secondary NFT sales, as well as several online and offline rewards, such as access to events and early viewings to streaming services and others. The initiative is the result of a partnership between MBC Group, Zurich-based technology and go-to-market advisory firm Ancore Strategy, and commercial and business development company Aftermedia. Pavel Jakovlev, founder and managing partner of Ancore Strategy said: “It’s exciting to push the envelope of NFT technology in the region’s first-mover collection. This becomes even more interesting as we explore the ‘Fananees’ utility in gaming and the much-anticipated metaverse.”
