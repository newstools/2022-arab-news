RIYADH: Global digital infrastructure company Edgnex has chosen the Kingdom as its first location for its $1 billion planned data center empire across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The facility, which is projected to launch in the third quarter of 2023, will have a power load of 20 MW, and will cover an area of 17,720 square meters. “We want to help attract hyperscalers and innovators from around the world and give them a foundation for growth in the Kingdom,” Telecom TV reported, citing Niall McLoughlin, Senior Vice President of property developer Damac Group. The facility aims to deliver new speed and agility to cater to local economies, enterprises, and end users. Edgnex’s decision to expand to the Kingdom is attributed to the country’s dynamic ICT market, strategic location for data center investment, and the growing data usage in the region. In line with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, the facility will help diversify the Gulf country’s economy. US real estate company JLL has been selected as managing partner for Edgnex’s proposed data center empire.
