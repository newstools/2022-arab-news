LONDON: The Rising Giants Network announced on Thursday the release of three new podcasts this Ramadan, including a highly-anticipated immersive adaptation of the life of the Prophet Muhammad. The three shows, “Al-Rasool,” “Al-Tikriti” and “Abu Abdo Al-Hakawati” will be available to listeners on all major platforms including Apple, Spotify, Deezer and Anghami, from April 2. “Al-Rasool” is an Arabic narrative podcast which retells the widely known story of the Prophet Muhammad. Presented in an immersive manner, it will delve into his trials and tribulations as a human, son, husband, prophet, and leader.   This podcast presents the whole story of his life and journey, before and throughout prophethood, his message, and the hardships he encountered, with a focus on authenticated narratives of his knowledge, teachings, and leadership. The show is composed of 10 episodes, scheduled to air throughout Ramadan and targeted towards an Arabic speaking audience. The second Ramadan special, “Al-Tikriti,” will delve into the life of Saddam Hussein in a narrative style show voiced by Iraqi voiceover artists.   Capturing the journey of the man known variously as “The Lion of Tikrit” and “The Butcher of Baghdad,” this podcast will be a haven for history enthusiasts and those interested in the life of the former Iraqi ruler. Last but not least, the successful show “Abu Abdo Al-Hakawati” (Abu Abdo the storyteller) returns for a second season this Ramadan. It will tell tales from across the globe with powerful lifelong lessons and metaphors provided throughout the show.
