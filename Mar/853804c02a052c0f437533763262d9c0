RIYADH: Saudi Advanced Communications and Electronics Systems Co., ACES, has partnered with China Electronics Technology Group to manufacture unmanned aerial vehicle payload systems in the Kingdom. This came after the Riyadh-based telecommunication firm established a new company for unmanned aircraft in the Kingdom, under the name of Aerial Solutions. China Electronics Technology Group, the state-owned defense conglomerate specializing in dual-use electronics, will aid in establishing a research and development center and manufacturing team for various types of unmanned aerial vehicle payload systems. This comes in line with Saudi Vision 2030 as the Kingdom aims to localize the field of military industries and maximize the sector’s contribution to the national economy.
