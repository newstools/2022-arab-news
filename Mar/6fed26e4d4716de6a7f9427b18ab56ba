RIYADH: The Coalition fighting to restore legitimacy in Yemen has destroyed an explosive-laden boat in the port city of Hodeidah, Al Hadath TV reported Sunday. The destruction of the boat, off the Yemeni coastal city of Hodeidah, thwarted an imminent attack on shipping in the Red Sea, the TV channel said. “Our efforts have contributed to protecting maritime shipping lines and global trade,” the coalition said.
