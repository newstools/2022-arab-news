For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle In its latest Barbie role models line-up, toy maker Mattel is paying tribute to women from around the world, including US producer Shonda Rhimes and British make-up artist Pat McGrath. Mahfouf, 24, took to Instagram to share a picture of her doll from the collection to her 3.6 million followers ahead of International Women’s Day. A post shared by Lena Situations (@lenamahfouf) “When I was little, I didn't have a Barbie that looked like me physically,” she wrote. “I spent the first few years of my life resenting my parents for not having created me white, blond and with straight hair, because it was for me, until very recently, the only definition of beauty,” she continued. “Today Barbie has chosen me to be the spokesperson for the ‘Ceiling of Dreams’ project to help all people believe in themselves. I admit that seeing this little doll with curly hair in her yellow suit and carrying a little book in her hand feels like the ultimate revenge,” she said. “Thank you @barbie for this honor, and for letting me be a part of affirming diversity for all children. I'm adding this unique little doll to my museum (the shelf in my living room, lol). Anything is possible!” she concluded.
