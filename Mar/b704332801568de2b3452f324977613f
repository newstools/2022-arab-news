RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s largest retail pharmacy chain, Nahdi Medical Co., has launched what it claims is the first smart distribution center across the Middle East and North Africa region for the retail sector. IMDAD, the 250,000 square meter center, was built under the patronage of the Saudi Authority for Industrial Cities and Technology Zones, known as MODON, which oversaw its development. Located in the second Industrial Zone of Jeddah, it is expected to cater to the needs of customers for 200 million products across the Kingdom. “Ensuring shorter delivery timelines is an integral part of enhancing guest experience. IMDAD is well-equipped with smart storage and automated order processing technology to increase product sorting and dispatching efficiency,” chief executive officer, Yasser Joharji, said. “The development of the first smart distribution center across the MENA region for the retail sector reflects Nahdi’s commitment towards achieving the Kingdom’s Vision 2030,” Joharji added. The IMDAD Project was a recipient of the International Federation of Consulting Engineers, or FIDIC, Contract Users' Award for ‘Highly Commended Contract Client of the Year’ in 2021.
