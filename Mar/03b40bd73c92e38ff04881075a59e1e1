JEDDAH: The launch ceremony for a tactical exercise to combat marine oil pollution was held on Tuesday in the Tabuk region. Organized by the Saudi National Center for Environmental Compliance, the response 7 drill aims to share and exchange experience and knowledge among participants in line with international best practices. During the launch ceremony, the NCEC showcased its findings in collaboration with more than 50 government entities. The findings ensure readiness and preparation in case of an emergency situation taking place in the Kingdom's waters, in line with government plans and programs. The ceremony was initiated by the undersecretary emirate of the Tabuk region, Muhammed Al-Haqbani, with the participation of Ali Al-Ghamdi, executive director of the NCEC, and public and private sector bodies. The NCEC explained the plan and strategies implemented by the different entities participating in the exercise and their different roles in the water, as well as showcasing and explaining several pieces of equipment and technology used by the center. Response 7 is an important part of the efforts by the NCEC, which aims to ensure readiness in case of a marine pollution emergency in order to achieve the country’s national environment strategy. It is the first tactical exercise of the current year to combat oil pollution in the Kingdom's waters. The previous tactical exercise, response 6, was carried out in the Al-Sharqia region last October. It included the participation of 40 public and private sector bodies. Response 6 had more than 500 participants. During the exercise, drones were used to monitor the hypothetical locations of an oil spill at a volume of 90,000 barrels in the waters of the Arabian Gulf. It was the first time the exercise implemented the hypothesis of affecting five vital and sensitive sites. Tuesday's opening ceremony also included an exhibition featuring all entitites participants in the tactical exercise alongside the NCEC.
