LONDON: A bid to buy Chelsea FC by the Saudi Media Group has failed to make the final shortlist, British media reports said on Thursday. The Saudi consortium was one of a host of bidders attempting to buy the Premier League club from Russia owner Roman Abramovich, whose assets were frozen by the British government following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Raine Group, handling the sale started informing prospective buyers of the status on their offers. The Saudi bid, fronted by Blues fan Mohamed Al-Khereiji, was reportedly the first to be told their bid for Chelsea has been rejected. Saudi Media said its offer was not connected to the Saudi government. Both the British government and the Premier League will have oversight of Chelsea's sale, in light of Abramovich's sanctions. Chelsea must operate under strict government licence until a new buyer is found, with Abramovich unable to profit from Chelsea's sale. Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly is among the front-runners to be the new owner, with Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family also in line to make Raine's shortlist of preferred bidders. Martin Broughton and Lord Sebastian Coe have another potent offering lodged, with strong financing secured and both front men say they are proud of the submission. British property tycoon Nick Candy has pushed hard with his offer for the Blues, while London-based global investment firm Centricus has also submitted a bid. * With AFP
