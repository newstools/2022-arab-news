DHAHRAN: Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Communications and Information Technology spoke to the crowd at Ithra’s Sync Summit on Wednesday about technology, its digital tools and the impact that it all has on both individuals and organizations. “Today’s leadership is about teaching them how to think; tomorrow’s leadership is about helping them how to re-think, and I’m fully confident with the amazing energy and talent, and youth and women that we have here in the room, we’re in good hands,” Abdullah Al-Swaha said. He praised Ithra and Saudi Aramco’s CEO, Amin Nasser, for having the foresight to initiate and host the groundbreaking two-day summit in the heart of Dhahran.  Al-Swaha described it as “collaborating as a whole” for the country. “We encourage public and private sectors to work together to ensure that policies and legislation maintain digital well-being at all levels, and speaking of the role of (the) sector, we commend the tremendous effort done by Ithra and Saudi Aramco in the areas of digital and transformation and wellbeing,” he said.
