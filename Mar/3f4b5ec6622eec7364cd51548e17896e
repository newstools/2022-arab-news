Saudi Arabia’s Hussein Al-Taweel on Monday night claimed a gold medal at the 2022 Asian Fencing Juniors & Cadets Championship held in the Uzbek capital Tashkent. In the final of the epee category, Al-Taweel defeated Alexandr Fedotov, of the Kazakhstan national team, 15-11, to claim a first top-podium finish for the Saudi contingent at the tournament, which runs from Feb. 24 until March 4. It is only the second Asian gold medal in the history of Saudi fencing, after Salah Al-Saqr’s in 1996 in Jakarta. Al-Taweel is considered one of Saudi Arabia’s most promising fencers, and holds the No.1 ranking in the epee category in the Kingdom.
