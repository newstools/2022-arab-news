On the auspicious occasion of the 82nd Pakistan Day, I wish to convey my heartiest felicitations to all Pakistanis, particularly those residing in Saudi Arabia. March 23 is a significant milestone in Pakistan’s history. It was on this day that the Muslims of the subcontinent decided to turn the dream of Allama Iqbal into reality and launched their heroic struggle for the creation of an independent homeland. Seven years later, Muslims succeeded in achieving their objective and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was founded under the leadership of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah. It was a historic feat, as the founding of Pakistan was achieved without war, by moral and intellectual force. Since its inception, Pakistan has achieved significant socioeconomic development and progress. Pakistani expatriates have played an important role in this progress. I would like to acknowledge the valuable contribution of the vibrant and dynamic Pakistani community in Saudi Arabia. Our community has served both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia alike with loyalty, commitment and dedication. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia share common political, strategic and socioeconomic objectives. The relationship between the two brotherly countries is unique and deep-rooted in history. Pakistan fully supports the structural-reform policy of Saudi Arabia through the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 project. Pakistan is confident that with the support of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Pakistan will be able to develop effective and valuable partnerships with Saudi Arabia for the mutual benefit of the two brotherly countries. On this auspicious occasion, let us pledge to enhance our efforts to further deepen the existing, time-tested relationship between Pakistan and the brotherly Saudi Arabia. Let us pray for the security and prosperity of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Long live Pakistan. Long live Pakistan-Saudi Arabia friendship. • Khalid Majid is the consul general of Pakistan in Jeddah.
