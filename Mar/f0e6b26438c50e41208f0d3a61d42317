RIYADH: Saudi Arabia is looking forward to welcoming US Secretary of State Antony Blinken “in the near future” to strengthen ongoing “positive” discussions, an official from the Kingdom’s foreign ministry said on Friday. “Saudi Arabia and the United States are working very productively across all levels of government to advance common interests of security and economic stability... Saudi and US officials are in constant contact at a technical level,” the official added. No date for a potential meeting has been scheduled yet in Riyadh, however. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan met with Blinken at the State Department in October last year. * With Reuters
