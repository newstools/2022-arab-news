RIYADH: Paul Levesque, better known to World Wrestling Entertainment fans as Triple H, has announced his retirement from the ring. In an interview with ESPN show “First Take,” Triple H discussed his cardiac issues that led to his decision, and what the experience has meant for his family. Now 52, he made his WWE debut in 1995 and is a 14-time world champion. He currently serves as executive vice president for global talent strategy and development at WWE. Levesque has been widely praised for helping cultivate the brand and recruiting new talent. Triple H was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2019 with his late-1990s group D-Generation X. He is a five-time world heavyweight champion, a five-time WWE intercontinental champion, and the winner of two Royal Rumble matches. The Connecticut resident was one of the most successful wrestlers of the 2000s. His wife is WWE chief brand officer Stephanie McMahon, who is the daughter of Chairman Vince McMahon. Triple H had his last televised match on June 7, 2019, against long-time rival Randy Orton in Saudi Arabia. His last WrestleMania match was also in 2019, with a win over long-time wrestling colleague turned Hollywood star Dave Bautista. Triple H is considered one of the greatest WWE superstars of all time, and received most of his fame working as a villain. He had rivalries with legends such as The Rock and Kurt Angle. His matches against John Cena, The Undertaker and Daniel Bryan have been praised by fans as the best matches in WrestleMania history.
