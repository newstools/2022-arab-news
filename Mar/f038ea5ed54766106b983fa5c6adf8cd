MAKKAH: Worshippers at Makkah’s Grand Mosque on Sunday performed the Fajr prayer without physical distancing, following a decision by the Ministry of Interior to lift the obligation at this and other mosques, including the Prophet’s Mosque. The use of face masks is still required. The Grand Mosque offers a safe environment: The air inside is purified several times a day, while the various facilities are sanitized using the latest technology to ensure the health of worshippers during prayer and other rituals. An official source at the Ministry of Interior said on Saturday that social distancing at the Two Holy Mosques and all other mosques in the Kingdom would end but that worshipers would still have to wear masks.   The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah said that permits, procured through Eatmarna or Tawakkalna, for performing Umrah and praying in the Rawdah at the Prophet’s Mosque are still required in order to lessen crowds and ensure a smooth journey. The Ministry of Interior stressed the importance of continuing to stick to the guidelines of the national plan for immunization, which include getting a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and following procedures to verify health status on the Tawakkalna app to enter facilities, including public transportation, and participate in events. The ministry explained that the above measures were subject to continuous evaluation by health authorities in the Kingdom according to developments in the epidemiological situation.
