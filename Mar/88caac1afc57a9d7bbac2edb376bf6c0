RIYADH: Harold Varner III delighted the golfing world after his colossal 92-foot eagle putt to win last month’s $5 million PIF Saudi International. From just off the 18th green, the American – in need of a birdie four to take good friend Bubba Watson to a tournament-deciding play-off – drained what will likely remain the best putt of the season. A month on, at this weekend’s Aramco Saudi Ladies International presented by Public Investment Fund, renowned golf content creators and some of the biggest names in the women's game decided to see if Varner III’s putt really was a one-in-a-million effort, challenging themselves at recreating the wonder-stroke. Major-winner Georgia Hall, Spain’s Carlota Ciganda and Olivia Cowan of Germany were just a few of the big-names to give it a try, alongside popular golf content creators Mia Baker and Sinéad McGrath, in a challenge hosted by Gabbie Partington. Their combined efforts have been shared on the Aramco Saudi Ladies International’s Instagram and Twitter channels on Friday, with mixed results. Play at the $1million Ladies European Tour event continues over the weekend, with former British Open champion Georgia Hall tied for the lead alongside Kristyna Napoleaova from Czechia going into Saturday’s third round.
