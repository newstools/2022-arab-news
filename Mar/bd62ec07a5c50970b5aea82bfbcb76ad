May Calamawy just may be the red carpet’s most exciting new face. The Palestinian-Egyptian actress is currently on a promotional tour for her latest project, Marvel Studios’ upcoming miniseries “Moon Knight,” and she has been serving up bold and glamorous looks that showcase her willingness to take fashion risks.   Calamawy set the tone for what was about to come when she attended the London premiere of “Moon Knight” at the British Museum wearing a red velvet power suit from Gucci. Shortly after, the Bahrain-born star flew to the US to attend the Los Angeles premiere of the upcoming Disney+ miniseries with her co-star Oscar Isaac and for the occasion donned a Tom Ford fall 2020 gown. The plunging, ombre dress was bedecked in pink and purple degrade sequins that rivalled the KiraKira app, which bathes everything in shimmering sparkles. The gown comes as a set with a matching sequined cardigan, however Calamawy decided to eschew the overlay, adding the right amount of tasteful risk-taking to her outfit. Featuring a halter neckline, an exposed low back, and a slit on the hemline, the “Ramy” star was impossible to miss in the showstopping party dress.
