RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Interior announced on Thursday that it has opened admission and registration for females to join the Border Guards at the rank of private.
The ministry’s General Department of Central Admission said that applications for admission will be received from Saturday, March 26 at 10 a.m. until Thursday, March 31 10 a.m., through the jobs section on the Absher portal.
In February 2021, the Saudi Ministry of Defense opened the way for both genders to join Saudi Arabia's armed forces.
Military ranks from private to sergeant were made available for women in the Saudi Arabian Army, Royal Saudi Air Defense, Royal Saudi Navy, Royal Saudi Strategic Missile Force, and Armed Forces Medical Services.
In September, the first group of female Saudi soldiers graduated from the Armed Forces Women’s Cadre Training Center, after completing 14 weeks of basic training.
