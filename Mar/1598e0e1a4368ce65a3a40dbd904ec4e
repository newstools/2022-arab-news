March 23 is a day to renew our commitment to adhering to the principles of justice and equity — the real objectives of the creation of Pakistan. Today, we pay tribute to the father of the nation and to all the leaders of the freedom movement who struggled to unite the country through their unparalleled sacrifices. It is important for our youth to note that Pakistan came into being through a long, democratic struggle, and now the key to its stability and development also lies in hard work, honesty and morality.
While commemorating this day, we need to adhere to the principles of unity, faith and discipline given to us by Quaid-e-Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah, and rededicate ourselves to the development of Pakistan as a truly democratic welfare state on the model of Riyasat-e-Madinah.
On this day, it is pertinent to reflect upon the challenges confronting us as a nation. Our government has brought in long-term reforms and initiatives to alleviate poverty and promote justice. Our focus remains on the marginalized segments of society and efforts to provide them with equal opportunities.
The Kamyab Pakistan Program offers huge economic benefits for our youth, farmers, small-scale businesses and the low-cost housing sector. Our flagship Qaumi Sehat Card initiative will provide universal health coverage to all citizens, which is unprecedented in the history of our country.
We are now on the path to regain our past glory, which was disrupted by previous regimes who gave importance to self-interest rather than the national interest and the welfare of the people. The struggle to eliminate corruption and improve moral standards will require the same persistence as our founding fathers persevered with during the freedom movement.
I pray to Almighty Allah to bless us with the strength to follow in the footprints of our great forefathers. Pakistan Paindabad. • Imran Khan is the prime minister of Pakistan.
