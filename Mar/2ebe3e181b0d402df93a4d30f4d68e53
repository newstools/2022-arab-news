RIYADH:The Riyadh Region Municipality has banned construction or demolition activities in the city from the Maghrib call to prayer (5-6 p.m.) until 7 a.m.
Violators of the prohibition will be fined SR10,000, the municipality said on its Twitter account on Tuesday.
The regulation aims to keep neighborhoods and residents free from disturbances, said the tweet.
The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development announced last summer a rule that bans working outside from 12 p.m. until 3 p.m. lasting until the month of September.
The ministry's decision was meant to protect workers from suffering heat exhaustion and sunstrokes.
