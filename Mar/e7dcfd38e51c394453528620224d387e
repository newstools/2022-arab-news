Saudi Arabia’s air defense forces destroyed six drones launched by Houthi militia targeting the southern part of the Kingdom, the Coalition said on Friday. The hostile attempts by the Houthi militia deliberately target civilian areas, energy installations, the Coalition said. The continued attacks by the Houthis threaten both regional and international security, the Coalition added. “We support the Gulf and international community in achieving successful negotiations with Yemen,” the Coalition said.
