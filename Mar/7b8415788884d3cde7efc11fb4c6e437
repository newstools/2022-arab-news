I am inspired by this initiative and delighted to be part of a project of such wide geographical and cultural scope,” he added. The hotel is expected to include 70 lavishly designed rooms, a high-end spa and two restaurants. It will be designed and furnished exclusively by Armani Casa and will include landscaped rooftops and terraces, as well as voluminous interiors and outdoor pools.

Once completed, the new Armani Hotel will join a lineup of unique districts, cultural institutions, museums, residences, restaurants and offices that make up Diriyah. An important development in the Kingdom’s Saudi Vision 2030, the ancient site is on a mission to be the most pedestrianized city in the Middle East while honoring its rich culture and heritage.
