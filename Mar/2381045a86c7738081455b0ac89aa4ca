DUBAI: The rules on parking in Dubai have been changed, with motorists having to pay up until 10pm six days a week, state news agency WAM reported. Parking fees will now be charged from 8am to 10pm Monday to Saturday, except Sundays and public holidays – while fees for multistorey carparks will be applied 24 hours a day, seven days a week. On Jan. 1 the UAE government moved the official weekend to Saturday and Sunday – but Friday parking remained free in Dubai up until now. Under the new ruling vehicles can be parked in public parking areas of Dubai for a maximum of four consecutive hours in roadside parking slots; 24 hours in parking lots; and 30 days in multi-storey parking facilities. According to the resolution, the director-general and chairman of the board of executive directors of the Roads and Transport Authority is authorised to change or reduce the timings for paid parking, and exempt certain categories of people, areas or time periods from parking fees, the report added. The Resolution is effective from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette.
