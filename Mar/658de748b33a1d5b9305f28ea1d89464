RIYADH: Experts from across the Gulf region have called for the development of a unified indicator to measure the impact of women’s participation in their nations’ economies. The call was made at a virtual forum hosted in the Kingdom on Monday, titled “Gulf Women: Leadership for a Sustainable Tomorrow.” Speaking at the event, Hala Al-Ansari, the secretary-general of the Supreme Council for Women in Bahrain, stressed the need to coordinate the positions of Gulf Cooperation Council countries on women’s issues. She said Bahrain had submitted proposals to the GCC countries, including “forming a joint coordinating committee” to consider relevant issues. The forum sought to shed light on the participation of women in the priority issues of the GCC, and to share countries’ expertise and experiences. Several papers were submitted, including ones on the role of women in achieving environmental sustainability and economic empowerment. The delegates highlighted the importance of enhancing women’s participation in the issues of climate change and renewable energy, and increasing the employment of female graduates in scientific fields. They also recommended strengthening the role of civil institutions on environmental issues, especially with regard to development investments, and for greater consideration to be given to regional studies, not just national ones. The delegates also called for the development of an education strategy that placed climate change, environmental sustainability and green economy on the curricula for the upper grades of primary school. The conference recommended harmonizing national plans in general and women’s plans in particular. It also called for the role of women to be strengthened in the security sector, and the establishment of a Gulf women’s police force.
