RIYADH: Saudis using cosmetic products, particularly hair dyes, have been advised to take two-day skin allergy tests to ensure items are safe for them to use. And the Saudi Food and Drug Authority has recommended that pregnant women avoid using hair dyes at all in their first trimester due to increased infection risks from products being used incorrectly. The authority also warned against mixing different hair dyes or other chemicals as doing so could cause irritation, burns or reddening of the skin, itching of the scalp, hair loss, and shortness of breath. The SFDA suggested that consumers read warnings on product packaging before use and verify validity.
