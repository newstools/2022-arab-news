RIYADH: Saudi Arabia isn’t responsible for any oil supply shortage to the international market that results from attacks on its facilities from the Iranian-backed Houthi terrorist militias, Saudi Press Agency reported, citing an official source in Kingdom’s foreign ministry. “The Kingdom stresses the importance of the international community to realize the gravity of Iran’s continued behavior of equipping the terrorist Houthi militias with ballistic missiles technology, and advanced UAVs with which they target the Kingdom’s oil, gas and refined products production sites,” the statement said. The statement comes one day after Yemen’s rebels launched a series of attacks targeting the kingdom’s oil and natural gas production. Benchmark Brent crude oil stood at over $112 a barrel in trading Monday. The attacks are “resulting in serious consequences for upstream and downstream sectors affecting the Kingdom’s production capability and it’s ability to fulfill its commitments, and undermining without a doubt, the security and sustainability of energy supplies to global markets.” The official source, cited by SPA, highlighted the importance of the International community to undertake “its responsibility to preserve the energy supplies and stand firm against the Iranian-backed Houthi terrorist militias, deterring their malicious attacks that represents direct threat to the security of oil supplies in these extremely sensitive circumstances witnessed by the global energy markets.”
