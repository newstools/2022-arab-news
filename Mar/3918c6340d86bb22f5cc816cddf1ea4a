RIYADH: More than 75 US defense and technology companies participated at Saudi Arabia’s World Defense Show this week to ink strategic partnerships in the Kingdom. Brig. Gen. Thomas D. Crimmins, a senior military representative at the US Embassy in Riyadh, told Arab News that the US government and its defense department recognize Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s desire to get to 50 percent localization in the defense industry. He further said that the US government and its companies in the defense sector are ready to offer support in all areas. We don’t look to sell equipment. We don’t look to sell defense articles. We look to cement the strategic relationship Brig. Gen Thomas D. Crimmins “There are many small US companies here that are in the Kingdom for the very first time, and this defense show gives them the opportunity to establish themselves,” Crimmins said. “It’s truly impressive. The US sees the only way to do business here in the Kingdom in the future is through that localization effort.” He added: “We don’t look to sell equipment. We don’t look to sell defense articles. We look to cement the strategic relationship.” Crimmins, who spent a year in the Kingdom seven years ago, told Arab News of the changes he has personally witnessed, especially in the defense sector. “You have to be on the ground to understand the changes that are going on here in the Kingdom, and I will tell you that almost all of our visitors this week have just been eyes wide open, just amazed,” he said. “To see Saudi women and their participation, their talent, their enthusiasm for working here in the Kingdom and working in the defense industry has been truly impressive,” he added.
