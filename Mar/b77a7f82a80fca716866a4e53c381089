LONDON: An Israeli TV news channel broadcast “live footage” of the Ukraine conflict — featuring a crash-landed spaceship from the “Star Wars” universe. The clip, aired on Channel 13, also showed stormtroopers, fictional characters from the franchise, standing near the wreckage.  Here is the original news footage (see time 0:08)pic.twitter.com/sCRPWO5f7Z — Dr. Eli David (@DrEliDavid) March 1, 2022 An investigation into the incident has been launched, and the editor responsible for the segment suspended, after the footage was aired during a montage of the destruction in Ukraine. The clip was originally part of an advert produced by Disney and Lucasfilm in 2014 to promote a new “Star Wars” channel on Sky Deutschland.   In the clip, stormtroopers are seen surveying the crashed ship on a German autobahn while cars zoom past. The original caption said: “Warning: Unsecured crash on the A3. Please turn right and do not overtake!” A significant body of footage purporting to show the conflict and the aftermath of heavy fighting has been circulating online since Russia invaded Ukraine. Both sides have warned of misinformation being spread by each other as the crisis continues to unfold.
