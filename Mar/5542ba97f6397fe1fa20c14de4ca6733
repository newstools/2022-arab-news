DUBAI: French luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton has for the first time unveiled a collection of clothes for Ramadan 2022. Up until now, the Parisian maison’s Ramadan capsule collections were made up strictly of leather goods and footwear. In addition to ready-to-wear, the capsule collection also includes a fragrance. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle   The offering is built around a color palette of emerald green (green is also associated with Islam) and the theme “love, peace, and prosperity” to reflect the essence of the holy month. Polka dot, broderie anglaise and laise are the key elements utilized throughout the collection, which features an embroidered blouse, a layered mid-length dress and a cozy pajama set. The ready-to-wear line is complemented with five of the brand’s most iconic handbags, including the Alma BB, Capucine Mini, Dauphine Mini, Coussin PM and Petite Malle, which are reworked into emerald and black.   When it comes to footwear, slingback pumps, mules and ankle boots come in multiple heel heights and shades of green. Completing the Ramadan collection is the release of Louis Vuitton’s most recent fragrance, Fleur du Desert, which pays tribute to the extensive olfactory culture of the Middle East.   Those who wish to get their hands on the new pieces can shop the collection solely at Louis Vuitton stores across the region.
