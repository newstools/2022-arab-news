DUBAI: Alaia is having a major moment. Celebrities can’t seem to get enough of the Paris-based label founded by the late Tunisian couturier Azzedine Alaia and now spearheaded by Belgian designer Pieter Mulier. The brand has been spotted on everyone from model Paloma Elsesser to singer and entrepreneur Rihanna, who last month stepped out wearing a long, hooded red leather coat custom-made by Alaia. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle Now it seems that “Euphoria” star Alexa Demie is taking a sartorial cue out of Rihanna’s fashion playbook. Demie attended the British Vogue and Tiffany & Co. Fashion and Film Party 2022 at Annabel’s in London on Sunday and brought the red carpet to the party in a bright crimson, hooded body-con dress with a matching shawl. The look was plucked from the Alaia Spring 2022 ready-to-wear collection, Mulier’s debut collection honoring the legacy of the label’s founder, who passed away in 2017 from a heart attack. With its scuba-esque hood and form-fitting silhouette, the dress combined athleisure and evening wear into a single, showstopping piece. Haute hoods are a signature of Alaia’s. One can’t think of them without recalling Grace Jones’ on-screen wardrobe — created by the late Tunisian designer — as hitwoman May Day in the 1985 James Bond film “A View to a Kill.”   Demie accessorized her gown with a pair of black leather wedges and eschewed any bold jewelry to allow the dress to truly shine. Red is one of Demie’s signature power colors. Who could forget the red fur-trimmed Balenciaga coat the actress wore to celebrate the debut of the second season of “Euphoria?” Indeed, red is a tricky color to pull off, but Demie does it with aplomb.
