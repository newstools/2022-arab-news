Following wins at the Elimination Chamber in Jeddah last month, RAW Women’s champion Becky Lynch is set to defend her title against Bianca Belair at WrestleMania on Saturday, April 2. Since making her return at SummerSlam following the birth of her first child and reclaiming her title in a 26-second match against Belair, Lynch has been on a roll that has seen her defeat past, present and future champions like Liv Morgan and WWE Hall of Famer Lita. While Lynch was able to retain her RAW Women’s title at the recent premium live event in Jeddah, Belair’s win in the Elimination Chamber match helped secure her place in the ring against Lynch at WrestleMania 38. Meanwhile, recent episodes of RAW have seen more confrontations between both superstars. On last week’s RAW, Big Time Becks — as Lynch is also known — succeeded in taking Belair out of the game with another attack, which led to a severe throat injury, putting Belair out of action for an unspecified amount of time in the buildup to WrestleMania. This year’s WrestleMania 38 at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas has been dubbed “the most stupendous two-night WrestleMania in WWE history,” with the action kicking off on April 2.
