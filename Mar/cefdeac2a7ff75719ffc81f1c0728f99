The Saudi women’s cricket team is set to face Bahrain in their third match of the GCC Women’s Twenty20 Championship Cup on Tuesday at Al-Amerat Cricket Ground. The Kingdom have lost both of their matches at the tournament so far. On Monday evening, the Saudi team lost their second fixture by 182 runs against Oman. The Omani innings had produced a total 234, for only three wickets, but the Saudis could only manage 52 in response. In their opener against Kuwait on Sunday, the Saudis lost by 10 wickets after managing just 31 runs, with their opponents hitting their target without losing their opening batters. The Saudi team will follow up tomorrow’s clash with Bahrain with matches against the UAE on Thursday, March 24, and Qatar the following day. Oman currently lead the standings after two wins, followed by Kuwait, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
