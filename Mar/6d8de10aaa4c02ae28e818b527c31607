JEDDAH: King Abdullah Economic City will host the third edition of the Aramco Saudi Ladies International golf tournament presented by the Public Investment Fund from Thursday, March 17. The four-day, $1 million event, which is part of the Ladies European Tour, will be held at the Royal Greens Golf and Country Club, the premier 18-hole championship golf course and clubhouse at KAEC, with views of the Red Sea coast as its natural backdrop. The tournament will feature top-ranked women golfers, including Anna Nordqvist and Georgia Hall, with free public entry on all days. Commenting on KAEC’s readiness to host leading global sporting events, Cyril Piaia, CEO of Emaar, the developer of KAEC, said: “We are delighted to host the Saudi Ladies International once again in our beautiful city of KAEC, bringing back the best players in the world.” In February, KAEC hosted the Men’s PIF Saudi International, with Harold Varner III sealing the win at the Royal Greens Golf and Country Club. “In line with the aspirations of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, we look to strengthening the country’s position at the forefront of global sporting activities. We’re proud that KAEC provides a vision-ready platform to host such events in the country,” Piaia said. The tournament will hold its first ladies day on Friday, March 18, with activities for women and girls, including free golf lessons led by LET professionals, as well as the chance to meet women golf stars and sign up for year-round coaching. As part of pre-event activities to strengthen interest in the tournament, a mini-golf hole and backboard will be sent to KAEC’s leading leisure destinations, including Views and Bay La Sun. Six mini-golf holes will also be set up at the corniche to encourage people to try the sport.
