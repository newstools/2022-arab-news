RIYADH: The Saudi government has deactivated 325,277 land mines in Yemen laid by Houthi militia, clearing routes for much-needed humanitarian aid aimed at supporting the country’s embattled citizens. Implemented by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center, the Saudi Project for Landmine Clearance in Yemen dismantled 1,352 mines in the second week of March. This figure includes 14 anti-personnel mines, 935 anti-tank mines, 395 unexploded ordinances and eight other explosive devices. The project is one of several initiatives undertaken by Saudi Arabia on the orders of King Salman to help ease the suffering of the Yemeni people. The demining took place in Marib, Aden, Jouf, Shabwa, Taiz, Hodeidah, Lahij, Sanaa, Al-Bayda, Al-Dhale and Saada. More than 1.2 million mines have been planted by the Houthis, claiming the lives of hundreds of civilians. The Saudi project trains local demining engineers and provides them with modern equipment. It also provides support to Yemenis injured by the devices. In July 2021, the project’s contract was extended for another year at a cost of $33.6 million.
