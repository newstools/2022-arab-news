Saudi Arabia’s defense sector has been praised for its pace of innovation by the CEO of BAE Systems. “The progress has been so rapid in the Kingdom, it’s been one of the hottest innovations ecosystems I’ve ever seen,” Charles Woodburn said at the World Defense Show in Riyadh on March 7. Woodburn was speaking not long after the chairman of Saudi Arabian Military Industries revealed the firm acquired more than SR10 billion in business and deals last year, and has secured SR6 billion this year so far. Also speaking at the WDS, Munir El Desouki, president of King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, argued that modern warfare has become a game of emerging technology. During his address at the Defense and Technology Leadership Forum, he cited the example of a drone that crashed on the White House in 2015, which ultimately resulted in over 400 companies beginning their work on counter-drone technologies. El Desouki also revealed KACST is currently working on harnessing start-ups and SMEs to integrate into the supply chain system. He added that top scientists and researchers from all over the world are frequenting KACST to train, teach and further the research center’s work in driving the innovation ecosystem. Faleh Al-Sulaiman, governor of the General Authority for Defense Development, said during the forum the authority will be playing its role to increase the 50 percent set target of localizing defense technology to a higher figure in the future.
