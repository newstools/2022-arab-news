RIYADH: Saudi authorities on Friday thwarted an attempt to smuggle 1.6 million Captagon tablets through Jeddah Islamic Port. The highly addictive and illegal amphetamine pills were hidden inside a touring caravan shipment. Zakat, Tax, and Customs Authority officials based at the port found the drugs stashed away in the caravan’s floor cavity during routine security searches. After seizing the tablets, the authority said it coordinated with the General Directorate of Narcotics Control in the arrest of three suspected recipients of the items. The latest discovery was part of ongoing efforts to crack down on drug smuggling networks in the Kingdom. The Saudi government has urged anyone with information related to suspected smuggling operations or customs violations to call the confidential hotline on 1910, international number 00 966 114208417, or email 1910@zatca.gov.sa.
