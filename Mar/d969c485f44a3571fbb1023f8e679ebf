American aircraft manufacturer Boeing plans to fly on 100 percent sustainable aviation fuels by 2030, a company’s top executive revealed during the World Defense Show currently taking place in Riyadh. CEO of Boeing Global Services Ted Colbert said that the commercial and defense aircraft manufacturer is trying hard to reduce carbon footprints so that sustainability can be ensured in the sector. Citing the example of the T-7 Red Hawk, he noted that Boeing is leveraging digital capabilities by delivering digitally-developed products. Leanne Caret, president and chief executive officer of Boeing Defense, Space, and Security added, “We have a number of opportunities that we have in conversation with a range of dignitaries specific to all domains from the seabed to space.” “What we can bring forward to the Kingdom is leverage upon our expertise and technology that we’ve been able to develop both on commercial space as well as military space,” she added.
