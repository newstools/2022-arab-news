RIYADH: Dubbed the “Most Stupendous Two-Night WrestleMania in WWE History,” WrestleMania 38 will feature the biggest showdown of all time as Universal champion Roman Reigns and WWE champ Brock Lesnar go head-to-head in a Winner Take All Championship Unification match next month. The clash comes in the wake of the fighters’ recent appearance at Elimination Chamber in Jeddah, which saw Reigns defeat Goldberg while Lesnar emerged as WWE champion following a six-man Elimination Chamber match with Seth Rollins, Austin Theory, Riddle, A. J. Styles, and previous champion Bobby Lashley. While Lesnar was originally scheduled to challenge Reigns at WWE Day 1, the first Premier Live Event of the year, the highly anticipated match at WrestleMania 38 will see both Reigns and Lesnar take to The Grandest Stage of Them All for a chance to take both victories as the Universal and WWE champion. Fans in the region can catch all the action from WrestleMania 38 weekend live and exclusively on WWE Network from April 1 to 3.
