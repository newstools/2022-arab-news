RIYADH: Egyptian start up and intelligence provider Intella announced the closing of a $1 million seed round during the Global Entrepreneurship Congress in Riyadh. The funding was provided by Hala Ventures, and will be used to segment Intella’s growth strategy and build more digital data products, with the aim to acquire over one million data points per day within the coming two months. “Saudi is one of our primary markets in terms of business,” Nour Al-Taher, co-founder and CEO of Intella, told Arab News on the sidelines of the GEC. Intella has recently agreed with the Saudi Ministry of Information Technology to provide analytical data on the Kingdom’s start ups. The analysis requires Intella to reach different ecosystems in the sector including investors, start ups, industry experts, and so on, she said.
