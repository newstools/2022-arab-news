DUBAI: Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio on Thursday held talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman regarding Saudi oil output in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. During their discussions, Japan’s premier praised the Saudi leadership for its role in stabilizing the crude oil market. They also exchanged views on the bilateral cooperation including the Saudi-Japan Vision 2030 framework and concurred on further continuing the close cooperation. Both leaders confirmed that they will further continue to coordinate on the situation in Ukraine, the ministry said. “Prime Minister Kishida stated Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is the outrageous action which constitutes a serious violation of international law, pointed out the importance of making efforts in cooperation with the international community, and expressed his intention to strengthen coordination with Saudi Arabia as a strategic partner, as it plays a leading role among Arab and Islamic countries.” The talks took place following the Russian invasion that has resulted in a raft of Western sanctions on Moscow and subsequent disruption to global energy markets. The situation has placed the spotlight on Gulf energy exporters, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, as countries look for supplies to replace Russian oil. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday visited the UAE and Saudi Arabia to bolster UK economic and business ties with the two nations. The West fears that maintaining oil output at current levels could lead to a sharp rise in the price of crude and ultimately trigger a global recession. * This article originally appeared on Arab News Japan
