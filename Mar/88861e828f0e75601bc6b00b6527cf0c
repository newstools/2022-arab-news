RIYADH: Shares in pharmacy chain operator Nahdi Medical Co. soared 14.8 percent in early Tuesday trading as it made Saudi Arabia’s biggest market debut since Aramco. The stock surged to SR150 ($40) at 10:37 a.m. Saudi time, implying a market value as high as SR19.5 billion. With a strong market debut, Nahdi opened 16.8 percent above its initial public offering price of SR131. “Our focus into 2022 and beyond will be firmly centered around two key objectives: redefining and transforming the future of healthcare in Saudi Arabia and delivering continuous value to our shareholders,” said CEO Yasser Joharji, commenting on the listing. Nahdi had raised $1.36 billion from its IPO, slightly higher than the $1.2 billion sold by ACWA Power a year earlier. The Jeddah-based giant pharma retailer operates over 1,150 pharmacies across the Kingdom and a rising number in the UAE.
