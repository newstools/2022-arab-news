When you’re in search of a distinctive style for that special occasion, you’ll definitely want to have a look at By People.
By People is a Saudi fashion brand set up by a couple based in Riyadh that specializes in unisex bags made of wood.
Each bag is an exquisitely ornamented work of art, redefining the concept of a fashionable bag.
The brand is inspired by the need to be distinctive. It is for those looking for quality and interesting designs when it comes to accessories.
Their bags are made of two main materials: Leather combined and teak or rosewood. Each piece takes around 15 days to make, with only 10 items of each design handcrafted in Indonesia.
The brand was launched in January and has handbags, shoulder bags, tote bags, laptop bags, mini-cupped purses and more.
Each bag includes words carved in wood on themes of happiness and hope from poems by famous Arabian poets.
The brand plans to offer personalized bags in the future where people can choose their favorite words, quotes or mottos.
