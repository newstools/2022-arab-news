DUBAI: Iraqi-Canadian rapper and professor Narcy, who was born Yassin Al-Salman, will be teaching the first-ever course about US rapper and designer Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) at Montreal’s University of Concordia, where he has been teaching for nearly a decade. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle Ye is inarguably one of the most influential, controversial (he was just suspended from Instagram for 24-hours) and complex celebrities of our generation, so it makes sense that the university is set to offer an entire class on his life and work. The news comes fresh off the heels of Netflix’s three-part Kanye West documentary “Jeen-Yuhs.” The rapper and full-time educator took to his Instagram account to announce the news, writing: “I will be teaching the first all @kanyewest class on a university level. Listen, in 2013 I was given the opportunity and blessing to teach at @concordiauniversity. A post shared by IRAQAFELLA (@narcynarce) “Over the course of years, I grew the class from 40 students to 200 a semester, moved us into an auditorium. I taught classes on ATCQ, Lauryn hill, @blackstarkeepshining … it became a huge part of my life and a responsibility. “Post-pandemic, Inshallah, I want to bring something new and fresh to students. An opportunity to bring more amazing guests to the university and to discuss the world through the lens of one of the most influential artists of our generation.” The course is titled “Kanye vs. Ye: Genius by Design” and will delve into the rapper’s work and the media. It is limited to 200 students. Narcy also stated: “This class isn’t only about Kanye. It’s about community, creativity, responsibility, accountability, fame and mental health, dreams and nightmares — and more importantly, self-actualization.” West joins a long list of celebrities who have had entire college courses dedicated to them, including Beyoncé, Frank Ocean and Taylor Swift.
