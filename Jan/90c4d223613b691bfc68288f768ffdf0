JEDDAH: The secretary-general of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation has called on member states to increase their financial backing for a humanitarian aid fund. Hissein Brahim Taha, said that the OIC’s Islamic Solidarity Fund had provided vital support for Muslims around the world but that more money was required to fund projects in areas such as helping refugees and victims of natural disasters. The organization’s leader made his appeal during a speech at the 65th session of the fund’s permanent council, that was held virtually on Monday. He described the fund as one of the most important Islamic charities and called for efforts to expand its reach through increased voluntary donations from OIC member countries. Taha also urged the fund’s board to continue with its support projects in Jerusalem, and health and educational programs in Palestine. The Islamic Solidarity Fund aims to advance Muslim communities by providing social and cultural material support while also offering urgent humanitarian assistance to Muslim countries and people affected by disasters and crises.
