RIYADH: Weather warnings have been issued for several regions across Saudi Arabia lasting until Tuesday, with a significant drop in temperatures, the country’s General Directorate of Civil Defense said Sunday as it urged people to be vigilant.
The authority warned of thunderstorms with light to medium rain and brisk winds that may lead to torrential flows in the capital Riyadh, the Eastern Province, Baha, Asir, Makkah, Tabuk, the Northern Borders, and Madinah.
It also forecast snow in the mountains of Tabuk, parts of Al-Jawf, and the Northern Borders. 
Civil defense spokesman Lt. Col. Mohammed Al-Hammadi called on everyone to be wary of the severe conditions, to stay away from places that could flood, and to follow the authority’s instructions and updates announced through news outlets and social media.
The directorate said that most regions would experience a significant drop in temperatures, reaching between zero and 5 degrees Celsius.
The warnings were issued based on data received from the National Center of Meteorology.
Al-Hammadi added that civil defense was ready to implement the necessary plans and measures for weather-related incidents.
Saudi civil defense issued a similar warning a week earlier, with Gulf countries having been on alert since the start of the year due to heavy rains that have caused torrential flows and a significant drop in temperature in recent days.
Meanwhile, a number of regions announced that schools would start at 9 a.m. from Monday until Thursday due to the drop in temperature and to ensure the safety and health of students and school staff.
