LONDON: An individual who was wanted on terrorism charges was extradited from Serbia with the help of Interpol and has been imprisoned, Bahrain’s Public Prosecution said. The individual was sentenced to four life sentences and a 10-year prison term for terror-related offenses between 2013 and 2015. He was also given a fine, Bahrain News Agency reported on Saturday. The individual had been found guilty of the attempted murder of police officers and citizens, and other terror offenses, the chief of public prosecution said. He added that the individual was involved in managing and training terrorist cells, and manufacturing and preparing explosive materials with the aid of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and other groups, in both Iraq and Bahrain. The individual was also involved in planning, directing and financing terror attacks in Bahrain, including one that targeted security forces in the Bahrain village of Al-Daih in 2014, which led to several police officers being killed, the chief of public prosecution added. Security forces were able to find evidence linking the individual to terror offenses, which also led to the confiscation of explosive materials.
