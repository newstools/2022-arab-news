Blending economic analysis with political drama, “EuroTragedy: A Drama in Nine Acts” is a groundbreaking account of the euro’s history and tragic consequences. In this vivid and compelling chronicle, Ashoka Mody describes how the euro improbably emerged through a narrow historical window as a flawed compromise wrapped in a false pro-European rhetoric of peace and unity, according to a review on goodreads.com. Drawing on his frontline experience, Mody situates the tragedy in a fast-paced global context and guides the reader through forced — and unforced — errors eurozone authorities committed during their long financial crisis.
