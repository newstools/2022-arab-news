CAIRO: A political consensus and a “roadmap” toward elections are necessary to resolve the crisis in Sudan, said Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. “Sudan represents Egypt’s national security,” he said during his participation at the World Youth Forum in the Egyptian city of Sharm El-Sheikh. “I say to the brothers in Sudan: Agree to dialogue and agree to continue moving forward. We support dialogue and consensus between the existing forces … We have a consistent policy of non-interference in the affairs of states.” Egypt’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Cairo “supports the current UN action in support of achieving stability in Sudan, by activating dialogue between the Sudanese parties, which would resolve and overcome the current crisis, and calls on all parties to work on choosing a new transitional prime minister, and forming a government as soon as possible.”
