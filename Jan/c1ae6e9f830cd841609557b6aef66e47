The UAE aims to obtain a quarter of the global hydrogen market, the country’s energy minister said on Monday. Speaking during the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week Summit, Suhail Al Mazrouei said the UAE is in discussions with many countries who are interested in blue and green hydrogen. The minister also talked up the importance of the circular economy, saying that adopting it makes sense commercially and helps in creating job opportunities in the country. According to Al Mazrouei, the UAE is one of the leaders in the shift to this type of economy, which emphasizes the reuse, repair and recycling of existing materials and products as much as possible.
