DUBAI: BBC Earth has announced that English broadcaster, author, and natural historian, Sir David Attenborough, will narrate “The Green Planet,” a new five-part series from BBC Studios’ Natural History Unit. Known for writing and narrating the nine-part Life series, Attenborough said: “This is a wonderful opportunity to explore a neglected yet truly remarkable part of the natural world.” Set to air in the Middle East and North Africa region from Jan. 10, “The Green Planet” aims to be the first immersive portrayal of an unseen, inter-connected world, full of new behavior and emotional stories from the world of plants. The series will transport viewers “into a world beyond their imagination,” said Mike Gunton, executive producer of the show. “The world of plants is a mind-blowing parallel universe; one that we can now bring to life using a whole range of exciting new camera technology. This is ‘Planet Earth’ for plants,” he added. The show’s producers have used new developments in robotics, moving time-lapse, super-detail thermal cameras, deep focus frame-stacking and ultra-high-speed to capture photographic and videographic detail that would be invisible to the naked eye. Attenborough travels to the US, Costa Rica, Croatia, and northern Europe, exploring terrains including deserts, mountains, rainforests, and the frozen north. “The Green Planet” premieres on Jan. 10 at 9 p.m.
