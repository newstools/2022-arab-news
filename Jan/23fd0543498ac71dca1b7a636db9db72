JEDDAH: Al-Mamlaka and Challenge on Wednesday secured their places in the final of the Saudi women’s National Football Championship after shock semi-final wins against Al-Yamamah and Jeddah Eagles at King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah. Al-Yamamah had won the Central division of the inaugural regional Football League while Jeddah Eagles had claimed the Western title to leave them favorites to reach Saturday’s final. However, Al-Mamlaka and Challenge, runners-up in the Eastern and Central divisions, respectively, had other ideas. In the first of the semis, Al-Mamlaka beat Al-Yamamah 3-1, with a brace from Samia Al-Awni and one goal from Yasmine Tabila. Noura Abdulmohsen scored Al-Yamamah’s consolation. The second semi saw Challenge edge past Jeddah Eagles 1-0 with a goal from Lara Al-Jammal. Al-Yamamah and Jeddah Eagle will meet on Saturday at King Abdullah Sports City in the third-place play-off before Al-Mamlaka and Challenge go head-to-head at the stadium for the right to become the first winners of the National Football Championship. The Women’s Football Department of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation recently announced that the winners of the championship will take home $80,000, with second place receiving $67,000, and third $53,000. In addition, $2,700 each will go to the best goalkeeper, player, and top scorer. The 16-team Regional Football League — organized by the SAFF — launched in December and was split into three divisions, with the top three teams in the Central and Western regions and the top two from the Eastern region qualifying for the National Football Championships, which kicked off on New Year’s Day.
