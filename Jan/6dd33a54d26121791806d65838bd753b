German multinational conglomerate thyssenkrupp plans to double its unit sales in Egypt to $113 million (100 million euros) within the next two years, Al-sharq reported, citing Andreas Beckers, head of Egypt’s unit. The company, which focuses on industrial engineering and steel production, saw sales in the Egyptian market of between 40 and 50 million euros in 2021. Doubling the expected business volume will come from the group’s expansion in the establishment of industrial complexes, either alone or through the existing partnership with the Nasr Company for Intermediate Chemicals in Ain Sokhna area, Becker added. Thyssenkrupp is in talks with a number of Egyptian companies such as Orascom Construction and Industry, as well as state petrochemical companies, to set up green fertilizer plants In addition, the corporation’s parent company is interested in investing in the Saudi city of "NEOM", as it includes many opportunities, especially in the renewable energy sector, Becky revealed. Announced in 2017, the “NEOM” city project aims to develop and diversify the economy of the world's largest oil exporter, in line with "Vision 2030”.
