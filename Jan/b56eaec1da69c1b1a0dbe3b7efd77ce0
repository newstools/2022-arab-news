JEDDAH: In the presence of President of Senegal Macky Sall and head of the Islamic Development Bank Dr. Mohammed Al-Jasser, the Dakar Regional Express Train was inaugurated in the capital Dakar on Sunday. The scheme is a massive project jointly funded by the IDB and the governments of Senegal and France. The IDB, however, is the sole donor to commit to both phases of the project. Running at a speed of 160 kph, the train will travel from Dakar city center to Diamniadio in 20 minutes, transporting around 115,000 passengers daily. This project is the first express train in Sub-Saharan Africa and will play a key role in addressing traffic and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the capital. Dakar, which is home to 3 million people, hosts around 20 percent of Senegal’s population and provides approximately 85 percent of employment opportunities nationwide. The IDB offered &euro;300 million ($340 million) for the first phase of the project and plans to invest &euro;100 million in the second phase, which will provide a cost-effective, eco-friendly trip on the 55-km road connecting Dakar city center with Blaise Diagne International Airport in less than 50 minutes.
