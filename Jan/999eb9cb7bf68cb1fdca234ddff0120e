The coach of the Saudi women’s national team Rania Bahloul has expressed her delight with the senior team’s second-place finish at the 2021 Arab Weightlifting Championship, which ended in Irbil, Iraq on Dec 31. The Saudi girls' team also finished third in the junior and youth category. “I am happy with what was achieved after we intensified the training in order to have a team that represents the Kingdom well, especially as we benefited from our experience in the international weightlifting championship that was held in Jeddah months ago,” Bahloul said. The Saudi women’s success follows that of the men’s team from the Kingdom, who were crowned champions in the senior category and runner-up for the junior and youth category at the same championship.
