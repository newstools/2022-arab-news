RIYADH: In 2021, the Saudi judiciary launched the electronic “Tanfeeth” smart electronic system in all the execution courts in the Kingdom. It aims to improve the quality of work whilst reducing time and and effort expended in the judicial system. The system shortens 70 procedures into five, and reduces five operating systems into one, characterized by interactive tools such as the smart alert feature, which speeds up the decision-making process for requests, and the processing of requirements for procedures automatically without the need for human intervention. Since its launch, Saudi courts received more than 800,000 requests that were handled 100 percent electronically. Meanwhile the “Shaml” initiative, launched by the Justice Ministry, won the National Dialogue Award, which is concerned with implementing the provisions of custody, vision and visitation, in the Excellence in Dialogue for Government Institutions branch, which witnessed the participation of 57 entities. There are 55 “Shaml” centers distributed across the Kingdom, which provided more than 236,000 services to around 40,000 beneficiaries.
