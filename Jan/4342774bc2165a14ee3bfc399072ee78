RIYADH: The Speaker of the Saudi Shoura Council, Sheikh Abdullah Al-Asheikh, arrived in the Bahraini capital, Manama, on Sunday, heading a delegation as part of an official visit to the kingdom.
His visit comes in response to an official invitation he received from Speaker of the Bahraini House of Representatives Fawzia Zainal.
During the visit, Al-Asheikh will hold official talks on Monday with the Bahraini parliament speaker to discuss a number of issues of common interest between the two sides, the Shoura Council said in a statement.
They will also discuss “ways to enhance cooperation and permanent coordination at the parliamentary level between the two councils, exchange parliamentary expertise and activate the role of the joint parliamentary committees.”
Al-Asheikh will also meet with his Bahraini counterpart to discuss the links of joint parliamentary cooperation between the Saudi and Bahraini shoura councils.
