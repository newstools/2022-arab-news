RIYADH: The Saudi Ministry of Justice has launched an e-service enabling beneficiaries to reissue a previous e-power of attorney by copying the same terms or parties.
“The e-service aims to fast-track the process, save time and effort, and improve client satisfaction,” the ministry said.
Beneficiaries can use the service by logging into the Najiz.sa portal, selecting “Issue e-power of attorney,” then “Copy previous power of attorney,” and entering the number of the previous power of attorney and the ID number of one of the parties. This step is part of the ministry’s efforts to digitize notarial services to streamline procedures.
Earlier in January, the ministry said its Notarial Central Support Unit had verified and certified over 1.2 million applications since Oct. 2020. The applications included 159,000 marriage e-contracts and 200,000 title deed digitization requests. Other applications included the registration of corporate accounts and probate certifications.
“The Central Support Unit works to enhance the digital transformation of notarial services and provide a unified operations center with standardized processes,” the ministry said.
