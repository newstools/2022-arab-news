ADEN: The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center recently inaugurated a project in Yemen's Aden governorate to support and empower young people and to improve their livelihoods. The project includes giving them technical and artisanal skills to improve their quality of life and boost their economic recovery, the Saudi Press Agency reported. This will be achieved through vocational training programs for the most needed fields in the labor market: Electrical wiring, mobile phone maintenance, refrigeration, air conditioning, sewing, embroidery, pastry, car and bike maintenance, photography and montage. It will also be achieved by improving their skills in the fields of marketing and small business management, in addition to offering participants full grants that allow them to establish their own business and enter the labor market. So far, the project has helped 1,250 young people and 7,500 families in the governorates of Aden, Marib, Hadhramaut, Al-Mahrah, the West Coast, Lahij, Shabwah and Socotra. The Yemeni minister of social affairs and labor, Dr. Mohammed Saeed Al-Zaouri, said that empowering young people economically was one of the government’s main priorities in the next phase. He praised the efforts of KSrelief in adopting similar, important developmental projects and supporting economic recovery efforts in Yemen, drawing attention to the importance of implementing these projects to overcome the challenges resulting from the current humanitarian crisis. The head of the youth empowerment project, Iman Al-Zobairi, said the initiative aimed to provide trainees with employment opportunities to improve their income and that strict criteria were in place to choose participants. This project is part of a series of humanitarian and relief projects offered by the Kingdom, through KSrelief, to improve the economic situation and income of the neediest sections of Yemeni society.
