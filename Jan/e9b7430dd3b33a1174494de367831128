DUBAI: STARZPLAY is expanding its live sports offering by strengthening its partnership with Discovery Inc. to now offer GOLFTV as an add-on channel. The two companies signed a partnership at the beginning of last year, which saw Discovery Inc. launch its streaming service Discovery+ as an add-on channel on STARZPLAY. The streaming platform has been building its live sports catalog for some of the region’s biggest sports, such as football and cricket. Last year, it signed a deal with Abu Dhabi Media to livestream UFC content and events across the Middle East and it started a partnership with Etisalat to stream the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2021. “We have witnessed impressive success in launching and live streaming sporting events such as UFC, the epic football tournament AFC Asian Qualifiers for FIFA World Cup 2022, rugby and ICC T20 Cricket World Cup, and we are proud to expand our portfolio of live sporting events to include golf,” said Danny Bates, chief commercial officer, STARZPLAY. “Besides prestigious live tournaments like Arnold Palmer Invitational, The Players Championship, The Memorial Tournament, BMW Championship, Tour Championship and many others, our platform also offers previous championship games keeping our subscribers engaged and closer to their favorite players,” he added. GOLFTV, part of Discovery Inc., will be available as a stand-alone channel on STARZPLAY for $9.99. Existing subscribers will get free access to the add-on for one year. “We are happy to broaden our current discovery+ partnership with STARZPLAY by adding GOLFTV to their platform. Discovery Inc.’s GOLFTV offers an impressive catalog featuring live content, highlights and on-demand features for all tournaments,” said Francesco Perta, senior business development and distribution director, MEA, Turkey and Northeast Europe, Discovery.
