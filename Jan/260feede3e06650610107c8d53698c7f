Turki Altheeb has been the director of public relations and media at Jeddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport since 2014. Altheeb, who boasts over 20 years of experience in media and communication in both the government and private sectors, is also completing his doctorate program at the Jeddah-based King Abdulaziz University. His research title is “Towards building a model for activating the role of ICT in supporting the knowledge sharing at international airports in KSA.” In 2000, he received a bachelor’s degree in media and communication from King Saud University in Riyadh. Some 11 years later, he was granted a master’s degree in information systems by Arizona State University. Altheeb, a member of both the Saudi Journalists Association and the General Commission for Audiovisual Media, has attended many training courses on media and communication inside Saudi Arabia and beyond. From 2000 to 2004, he was a journalist at the Al-Watan newspaper before he moved to the Saudi Geological Survey, where he served as a public relations representative for some six years. In 2010, he became the director of the knowledge management department at the Saudi Geological Survey, a position he held for over four years. As media and public relations director at King Abdulaziz International Airport — the first international airport in Saudi Arabia — Altheeb has developed social media platforms for the airport to enhance travelers’ experience. These platforms enable passengers to communicate directly with the airport officials and receive the travelers’ feedback on the services provided. These electronic sites also help in promoting the brand name of the airport. Altheeb also supervises all local media tours to the Hajj and Umrah terminals at the airport. He also invites many international media representatives to the airport and provides them with all the necessary assistance to facilitate their Hajj and Umrah coverage.
