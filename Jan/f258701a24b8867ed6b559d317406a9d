RIYADH: Saudi Arabia's deputy defense minister said on Tuesday that the Houthis are using “false promises and repeated delusions”  to deceive Yemenis and recruit them to fight a “deadly war.” Prince Khalid bin Salman said the time has come for the wise people of Yemen to “renounce those illusions and promises, and to protect the free people of Yemen from the manipulation of the terrorist militia.” Saudi Arabia and Gulf states are seeking to include Yemen in the Arabian Gulf system so that its people can enjoy security, stability and development like Gulf nations, Prince Khalid said. “However, the Houthi militia chose terrorism and destruction and used the people of Yemen as firewood that serves the Iranian regime’s agenda,” the deputy defense minister said. He also expressed solidarity with the Yemeni people and said the Kingdom will always stand by them.
