Sales of citrus fruits, beets, and potatoes helped deliver a record year for Egyptian agricutural exports in 2021, exceeding 5.6 million tons for the first time. Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation Sayed El-Quseir noted that the figure was not even achieved in the pre-pandemic period. The total agricultural exports in 2021 increased by 486,760 tons from 5.1 million tons in the year 2020, a report showed. This comes as a result of Egypt’s efforts to support exports by opening new markets, equipping laboratories with the latest equipment, and developing the agricultural quarantine system to match international quality standards, El-Quseir said. The total agricultural exports of citrus fruits topped the list with around 1.8 million tons, followed by fodder beets with 650,340 tons, Ahmed Al-Attar, the head of the central department of agricultural quarantine, said. The next highest exports were potatoes, with 614,424 tons exported. Onions ranked fourth with a total of 276,141 tons, and grapes came in fifth place with a total of 143,450 tons.
