NEW YORK: The UN Security Council has unanimously condemned the deadly attacks on Abu Dhabi by Yemen’s Houthi militia as “heinous terrorist attacks” and called to bring the perpetrators to justice. The statement on the Houthis came after a drone attack by the Iran-backed Houthis near oil storage facilities in Abu Dhabi left two Indians and a Pakistani dead and caused a fire to break out at the UAE capital’s airport. Abu Dhabi Police said “small flying objects” were found at both sites, pointing to a deliberate attack using drones — a hallmark of the Houthis. Eight others were injured in the attacks. “The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the heinous terrorist attacks in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Monday, 17 January, as well as in other sites in Saudi Arabia,” the council said. “The members of the Security Council underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice.” UAE's representative Lana Nusseibeh said more international action was needed to hold the Houthis accountable, especially considering their actions not only threaten Emiratis, but also citizens from every UN member state. “The UAE cares deeply about our citizens and about millions of citizens from around the world who have made our country their home,” she said. She also said that as the Houthis themselves claimed responsibility for the attack, there was no question as to who must be held to account. She added the UAE was “strongly encouraged” that the council had joined more than 100 coutnries and international organizations in strongly condemning the attack, errorist attack. She stressed the UAE’s soverign right to defend itself, its people and its way of life as any nation in the same situation would do. * With AFP
