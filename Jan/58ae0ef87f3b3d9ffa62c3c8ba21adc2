RIYADH: Saudi municipalities have ramped up health and safety inspections to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the Kingdom. Eastern Province Municipality carried out 1,362 inspections of commercial centers and facilities in a single day, identifying 82 violations. Violations include noncompliance with mask-wearing, overcrowding issues and a failure to use the Tawakkalna app effectively. The app was launched in 2019 to track COVID-19 cases and has been updated to show vaccination information, including an individual’s status — such as vaccinated or infected. It now functions as a COVID-19 “passport.” Authorities in Jeddah issued 29 fines and closed 15 businesses for breaching protocols during 5,679 inspection rounds over the past two days. Asir Municipality also carried out 1,254 inspections of commercial centers and facilities in two days, identifying 35 violations. Makkah Municipality carried out 637 inspection tours across food facilities, shops and markets. These checks resulted in the destruction of 80 kilograms of unsafe meat and the arrest of three workers employed under expired health certificates. The Northern Borders Region Municipality also closed five commercial facilities selling molasses and tobacco products in violation of health requirements. The municipalities called on commercial facilities to abide by regulations to ensure public safety and prevent the spread of disease. Officials have also urged the public to report any suspected health breaches by phoning the 940 call center number, or by contacting authorities through the Balady app.
