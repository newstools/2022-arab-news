MOSCOW: Talks between the United States and Russia in Geneva were a “positive” start to continued dialogue amid tensions over Ukraine, the Kremlin said on Tuesday.“This deserves a positive assessment,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.“But this is not a process for the sake of process, and it is not something that can be satisfying, because what’s important here is the result. There is nothing to say yet about the result.”
