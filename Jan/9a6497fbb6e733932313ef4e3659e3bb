RIYADH: Payments giant Mastercard has partnered with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to make non-fungible tokens more accessible. Mastercards can be used to make purchases on Coinbase’s upcoming NFT marketplace. “We’re excited to announce today that we’re partnering with Coinbase to let people use their Mastercard cards to make purchases on Coinbase’s upcoming NFT marketplace,” Mastercard said in a statement. “Getting more people involved safely and securely is perhaps the best way to help the NFT market thrive.” Mastercard also sees greater potential for core NFT technology to go beyond art and collectibles in many other areas. Coinbase announced in October last year that it is launching an NFT marketplace. “Coinbase NFT, as a peer-to-peer marketplace that will make minting, purchasing, showcasing and discovering NFTs easier than ever,” Coinbase said. “We’re making NFTs more accessible by building user-friendly interfaces that put the complexity behind the scenes. We’re adding social features that open new avenues for conversation and discovery. And we’re going to grow the creator community exponentially, a win for artists and for fans.”
