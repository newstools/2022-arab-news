DUBAI: The Houthi attacks targeting civilian sites in Abu Dhabi were carried out with a battery of weapons including cruise missiles, and drones, the UAE Ambassador to Washington Yousef Al-Otaiba said. It is the first time the UAE has said missiles were used in Monday’s attack in which three people were killed and seven others were injured. The Houthi militia launched a number of drones and ballistic missiles, causing three tankers to explode near storage facilities owned by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC). There was also a fire at a construction site at Abu Dhabi during the attack. Al-Otaiba said the UAE intercepted some of the missiles. Earlier, the ambassador called on the US to Support re-designating the militia as a terrorist Organization. In response to the attacks, US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday his administration was considering re-designating the Houthis an international terrorist organization. The UAE had "long left the Yemen war," Otaiba said in his comments to JINSA. "Attacking a country that is not in combat makes a very clear case" to reinstate the Houthi terrorist designation.
