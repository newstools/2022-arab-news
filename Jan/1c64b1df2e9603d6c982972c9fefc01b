RIYADH: The Secretary-General of the Gulf Cooperation Council Dr. Nayef Falah M. Al-Hajraf stressed the importance of strengthening Gulf-Chinese relations to serve common interests, and the necessity of intensifying cooperation in areas of mutual interest. This came during the GCC secretary-general’s visit to China on Monday at the invitation of Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Al-Hajraf expressed his hope that the visit would contribute to strengthening Gulf-Chinese relations, in light of the framework agreement for economic, investment and technical cooperation signed between the two sides in June 2004, as well as the memorandum of understanding signed in 2010. The GCC secretary-general indicated that the visit represents an opportunity to review Gulf-Chinese cooperation and to strengthen security and stability. The file of free trade negotiations between the two sides for the tenth round of negotiations will also be tackled during the visit, as well as ways to enhance investment in bilateral opportunities in common areas, especially since China is the first trading partner of the GCC.
