RIYADH: Saudi Arabia's defenses on Monday thwarted a number of Houthi attempts to target the Kingdom, the Arab coalition said.
The Kingdom’s defenses intercepted and destroyed five drones that the coalition said it had been monitoring and were launched from the Yemeni capital Sanaa.
“Operational options are on the table in response to the threat and to deter the hostile behavior of the Houthi militia,” the coalition said.
Earlier on Monday, the Kingdom’s Ministry of Defense said air defenses intercepted and destroyed a “hostile aerial target” launched toward the city of Taif.
“The aerial threat was launched by the Houthi militia from inside Yemen,” the ministry said, adding: “We are taking deterrent operational measures to neutralize the threat and protect civilians.”
The Houthi militia have been launching near daily cross border attacks on the Kingdom’s southern region.
On Sunday, the coalition said three drones were intercepted and downed as they were headed for populated areas in Najran.
On Monday, the coalition also released footage of it intercepting and destroying the three drones launched by the Houthi militia toward Saudi Arabia’s southern region a day earlier.
Meanwhile, the Arab coalition said it had killed more than 97 Houthi fighters in airstrikes on Yemen’s Marib province in the past 24 hours.
The coalition added that it had carried out 12 operations targeting the Iran-backed Houthi militia in the energy-rich governorate and also destroyed five military vehicles.
It also said that it carried out 23 targeting operations in Shabwa, killing more than 133 militants and destroying 15 military vehicles.
