DUBAI: Reigning Slync.io Dubai Desert Classic champion Paul Casey warmed up for his title defense in style on Monday with a victory in the JA Lake View Hotel’s Rooftop Charity Challenge, ahead of this week’s Rolex Series event at Emirates Golf Club. After edging out Sweden’s Henrik Stenson in the final of the friendly match-play competition at JA The Resort Dubai, Casey also delighted the watching crowd by raising 15,000 Emirati dirhams ($4,084) for the Al-Jalila Foundation charity. With eight of this week’s Slync.io Dubai Desert Classic field playing from a purpose-built tee box at the hotel’s rooftop BIBE venue, the players scored points for landing chips closest to a pin 97 yards away and six stories down. In a field containing three Major winners, Casey looked in great touch throughout the knockout format, recording the highest score of each round to rack up convincing victories over Scotland’s Grant Forrest and Spaniard Rafa Cabrera-Bello on his way to the final, where he saw off 2016 Open champion Stenson. On the other side of the draw, Stenson beat US amateur Sam Bennett and defending rooftop challenge champion Adri Arnaus en route to the final, with former Masters champions Danny Willett and Charl Schwartzel both crashing out in the first round to Arnaus and Cabrera-Bello. Stuart McMurdo, director of golf at JA Resorts and Hotels, said: “A huge congratulations to Paul on winning the JA Lake View Rooftop Charity Challenge and thanks to all the pros for participating. We hope to welcome them back to JA The Resort Dubai soon and wish them the best of luck in the upcoming Slync.io Dubai Desert Classic.” After his final victory, Casey had one further challenge, a head-to-head, one-shot shootout against JA Resorts and Hotels teaching professional Amy Boulden. Casey planted his chip two feet from the pin to secure the charity donation for Al-Jalila Foundation.
