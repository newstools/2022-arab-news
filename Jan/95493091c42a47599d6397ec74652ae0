LONDON: Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed stressed the UAE’s support for stability in Kazakhstan and for preserving its peace, security, and institutions.
His comments came during a call with Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Monday, where he was briefed on the latest developments in Kazakhstan and the measures taken to establish security and protect the country’s institutions, state news agency WAM reported.
Nearly 8,000 people in Kazakhstan were detained by police during protests that descended into violence last week and marked the worst unrest the former Soviet nation has faced since gaining independence 30 years ago, authorities said on Monday.
During the call, Sheikh Mohammed “expressed his confidence in the ability of the Kazakhstan government and people to overcome this difficult period quickly,” the statement said.
Tokayev thanked the Emirati crown prince for his support for Kazakhstan, praising the strong ties between the two counties in various fields.
The two leaders also discussed bilateral relations and ways to develop them.(With AP)
