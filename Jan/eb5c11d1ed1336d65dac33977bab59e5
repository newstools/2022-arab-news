DUBAI: The niece of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei was arrested Thursday, Jan. 16 as she was making her way home in Tehran, Al Arabiya reported on Monday. Farideh Moradkhani’s brother, Mahmoud, who lives in exile in France, confirmed the news in an interview with UK-based media organization Iran International. Mahmoud Moradkhani said the Iranian regime was oppressive. He said in the interview: “She wasn’t a political activist. There is no freedom to become a political activist in Iran in the first place. She was a human rights defender who participated in charity work and peaceful demonstrations.” He added: “Of course, my uncle Ali Khamenei is aware of our opposition to the regime since it was first established decades ago.” And he said his family “would not be silenced.” Speaking with her family on the phone on Friday, Farideh said she was being moved to Evin prison. She had been previously called by Iranian intelligence for her criticism of the regime. Farideh campaigns for the abolition of the death penalty and for the rights of prisoners. No news on the cause of her arrest was provided.
