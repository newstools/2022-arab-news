The Riyadh Season Cup between Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and a combined Al-Hilal and Al-Nassr all-star team, slated for the third week of January, has been rescheduled because of disruptions caused to the French team’s preparations by the pandemic. The one-off match was set to feature stars such Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe in PSG colors taking on the combined Saudi team, which was to be chosen and prepared by former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. The new date for the match will be announced at a later stage.
