RIYADH: The Saudi Development and Reconstruction Program for Yemen, SDRPY, signed on Sunday a contract to rehabilitate the Heijat Al-Abed Road that connects Taiz governorate with other Yemeni provinces. SDRPY said that the road, which is 3,000 sq m above sea level and extends 8.7 km, has a “vital” importance to nearly 4,000,000 beneficiaries. With the road lacking basic traffic safety elements such as Jersey barriers, the project aims to repair damages and partial collapses to increase traffic safety and reduce accidents. The project is set to provide 210 job opportunities, as the road serves several economic and educational sectors. SDRPY has executed a total of 204 development projects and initiatives in Yemeni governorates in seven basic sectors, including education and health.
