RIYADH: The second semifinal of the Spanish Super Cup between Atletico Madrid and Athletic Bilbao is just hours away. The game kicks off at 10:00 p.m. in Riyadh, with Real Madrid awaiting the winners in Sunday’s final. “I will go anywhere it takes to win a title,” Bilbao defender Inigo Martinez told a pre-match press conference. Despite his confidence, neither side is having a great season. Reigning La Liga champions Atletico are currently fourth in the table and struggling for form. Even Antoine Griezeman has failed to rediscover the magic that endeared him to fans during his first stint at the club. Teammate Luis Suarez — Atletico's top scorer last season — has also been struggling in front of goal. Defending Super Cup champions Bilbao are currently ninth in La Liga and have also been short on goals. Their top scorer is Inkai Williams with just five for the season so far. The last time the two sides met the match ended in a draw. If Atletico Madrid get through tonight they will be keen to avenge their loss to Real Madrid in the 2020 final in Jeddah. Tonight’s match is being billed as a battle of two goalkeepers. Bilbao’s Unai Simon is first choice for the Spanish national side, while Madrid’s Jan Oblak is considered by many, not least his teammate Koke, as the best in the world. “We know the level of player he is. For me, he’s the best goalkeeper in the world,” Koke told a press conference on Wednesday. “Maybe we aren’t having the luck we’ve had in previous years. When our opponents shoot, they score. But Jan is our vice captain, he’s important. He looks strong. He’s focused on doing the same work that he’s done all these years, to keep improving and helping the group.”
