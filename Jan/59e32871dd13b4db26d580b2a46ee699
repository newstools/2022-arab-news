A post shared by Coachella (@coachella) Abdulhadi first gained international prominence after a 2018 Boiler Room appearance that amassed more than nine million views on YouTube, making it one of the platform’s most-watched sets to date. The Ramallah-born musician went on to become one of the most in-demand Arab DJs following her successful Boiler Room set. “The weekend of the Boiler Room, I got 40 booking requests in one day. Before, I would get 20 requests a month, if I was lucky,” she told DJ Mag in an interview. She went on to play at festivals like Nuits Sonores, IMS and Beyond The Valley. The artist was scheduled to perform at Coachella in 2020, before the event was canceled due to COVID-19.
