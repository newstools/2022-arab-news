RIYADH: The Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen said on Friday it carried out precise air strikes against legitimate military targets in Yemen’s capital Sanaa, Al Ekhbariya reported. They also destroyed a ballistic missile launchpad in Al-Bayda governorate, around 200km south-east of the capital. Earlier on Thursday, it is carrying out air strikes to destroy Houthi capabilities in Hodeidah. The port of Hodeidah is being used to smuggle Iranian weapons to the militia and is a threat to the freedom of maritime navigation, the coalition said. It added that the Houthis are taking advantage of the Stockholm Agreement as an umbrella for protection. Pirates and organized criminals are also operating from Hodeidah’s ports and the coalition has targeted a criminal den in Hodeidah, it said. US President Joe Biden said on Thursday returning the militia to the terror list was “under consideration,” following the group’s Monday drone strike on the UAE, which left three migrant workers dead.
