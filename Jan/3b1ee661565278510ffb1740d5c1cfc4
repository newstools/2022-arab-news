RIYADH: Saudi Health Minister Fahad Al-Jalajel on Thursday met with business leaders and representatives of private hospitals in the Kingdom. During the meeting, they discussed initiatives to develop the health sector and reviewed Ministry of Health projects and plans to improve healthcare services and industry performance levels. The ministry has been promoting increased investment in the sector through the adoption of international quality standards, while also establishing a business call center, working toward fully automating health licenses, supporting small and medium enterprises, and realizing government electronic integration. The involvement of the private health sector in the transformation process has been a key part of the Saudi government’s development and integration plans for the country’s public and private health systems. The private sector has recently worked alongside the government in helping to implement a number of coronavirus pandemic-related preventative programs and initiatives are already in place to strengthen links between public and private hospitals in the Kingdom.
