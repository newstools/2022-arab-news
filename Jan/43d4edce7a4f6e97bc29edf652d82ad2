BAHA: Light shows illuminated the facades of 58 palaces in the archaeological village of Dhee Ayn in Baha to celebrate the addition of Arabic calligraphy to UNESCO’s List of Intangible Cultural Heritage.
The Saudi Heritage Commission said the celebrations would last for a week and that light shows inspired by Arabic calligraphy, accompanied by audio shows, would highlight the value of this art form and its heritage as a symbol of Arab identity.
According to UNESCO, Dhee Ayn is one of the most important archaeological villages in the Kingdom. UNESCO said Arabic calligraphy was the ‘artistic practice of handwriting Arabic script in a fluid manner to convey harmony, grace and beauty.’ Its 58 multi-story stone palaces sit atop a mountain and surround a mosque that forms the nucleus of the village. It is famous for its abundant agricultural wealth and freshwater spring that has been spurting for hundreds of years.
The people of Dhee Ayn were proud of their village being chosen to celebrate the addition of Arabic calligraphy on UNESCO’s List of Intangible Cultural Heritage, the Saudi Press Agency reported, especially since many delegations and visitors from inside and outside the Kingdom went to the village to learn about its heritage and history.
The addition of Arabic calligraphy on the UNESCO list follows the efforts of the Kingdom in cooperation with 15 other Arab countries.
UNESCO said Arabic calligraphy was the “artistic practice of handwriting Arabic script in a fluid manner to convey harmony, grace and beauty.”
