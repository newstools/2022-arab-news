RIYADH: The Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen announced an operation to liberate the country from the Houthi militia on Tuesday. Coalition spokesman Brig. Gen. Turki Al-Maliki made the announcement during a visit to the province of Shabwa after it was liberated from the Houthis on Monday. Attending a joint press conference with the province’s governor, Awadh Mohammed Al-Awlaki, Al-Maliki said the operation, which started on Tuesday morning, aimed to “purify Yemen” and establish safety, security, prosperity, and growth in the country. “Yemen deserves a lot in all areas,” Al-Maliki said. He added that Shabwa united all Yemenis and that they rallied together in order to liberate it. “The Houthi militia has chosen the path of war” and its violations are clear to all, the spokesman said. On Monday, the governor of Shabwa announced that the province had been liberated after the Houthis had been expelled from Ain district, the militia’s last pocket of land in the province. The governor thanked the leadership of the coalition on Tuesday and said he valued the air support it provided that helped to regain Shabwa. He added that the coalition is a key partner in the achievements made. Earlier on Tuesday, the coalition announced that more than 350 Houthis had been killed in various operations in Yemen. In oil-rich Marib province, more than 120 Houthi fighters were killed and 14 military vehicles destroyed in operations over the last 24 hours. The coalition also carried out strikes in the southern province of Shabwa which resulted in the deaths of over 230 Houthis and the destruction of 25 military vehicles.
