Al-Dossaria Castle is one of the most important historical and archaeological landmarks in the Jazan region, as well as a tourist museum popular for its strategic location.
The castle is located on the city of Jazan’s highest peak, overlooking the Red Sea. It was built in a square shape over an area of 900 square meters, and consists of two floors, four cylindrical towers and foundations that were recently reinforced.
The floors and towers have several openings that were used for military purposes, while the southern and western barricades were added to serve as the first line of defense for the main structure, which sits 250 meters above sea level.
The castle was used as a fortress throughout several historical eras. Sheikh Abdullah Al-Qar’awi turned the monument into a place dedicated to teaching, studying and disseminating knowledge among the region’s students.
In 1932, King Abdulaziz ordered the castle to be restored and turned into the headquarters of the Saudi army. The restoration process was completed a year later and the first Saudi military garrison was stationed on the site.
A development project for the area surrounding the castle will link the site to Jazan’s internal market. This will create an attractive area around the castle for tourists and heritage enthusiasts, with tourism products displayed on the connecting pathway.
