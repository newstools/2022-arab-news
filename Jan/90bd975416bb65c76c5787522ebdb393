A post shared by Fai Khadra (@faikhadra) Oliver Peoples has previously collaborated with brands like The Row and Brunello Cucinelli, but this capsule collection marks the first time that the eyewear label has joined forces with a single individual. The new capsule comprises a line of sleek sunglasses that come in an array of colorways, and are perfect for everyday wear.

The frames, which are handcrafted in Italy, feature a custom embedded corewire designed by Khadra that is inspired by the elaborate intertwined pattern of barbed wire. The sunglasses retail at $560 and can be purchased online.
