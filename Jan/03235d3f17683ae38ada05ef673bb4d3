CAIRO: Egypt has said it intends to run for the presidency of the Global Counterterrorism Forum during a meeting of its coordination committee in March. The Foreign Ministry said the decision reflects Cairo’s keenness to contribute to strengthening international efforts to combat terrorism. Egypt is one of the founding countries of the forum, which was established in 2011 and has 30 member states. It cooperates closely with regional and international organizations, including the UN. Egypt has co-chaired the Capacity-building in the East Africa Region Working Group with the EU since 2017 within the forum’s framework.
