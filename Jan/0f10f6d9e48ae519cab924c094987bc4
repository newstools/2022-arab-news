LONDON: The UAE will exercise its right to defend itself against the acts of the Houthi militia, diplomatic adviser to the UAE President Anwar Gargash said on Friday. The UAE has the legal and moral right to defend its lands and residents, he said in a statement published by Al Arabiya. The Houthi militia rejected all calls for a ceasefire, and their attack on the UAE Rwabee ship prove their rejection of a political solution, the adviser said. The Houthis have turned the port of Hodeidah into a port for maritime piracy, he claimed, and are using it to finance the war. The UAE will do everything necessary to prevent the danger of terrorist acts on its soil, he said. Houthi rebels claimed credit for a cross-border drone strike on Monday that killed three migrant workers in the UAE. This lead to international condemnation. US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he is considering re-designating Yemen’s Houthi militia as an international terrorist organization after the attack.
