The Saudi Arabian Football Federation will hold a meeting with the heads of the country’s top tier league clubs in Riyadh next Tuesday to discuss increasing the number of foreign players allowed on their books in the coming seasons. Saudi Professional League clubs are currently allowed to register up to seven overseas players, and the Federation is considering raising that to eight when it meets the clubs and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of SPL next week. Last November, Arabic sports daily Arriyadiyah reported that that the SAFF and the SPL were in discussions about allowing eight foreign players to be named in starting line-up, or seven, plus one on the substitute’s bench, as was last allowed in 2019.
