Ronda Rousey and Brock Lesnar have emerged as the big winners from Sunday night’s Royal Rumble as 30 names from across the female and male rosters took to the ring at The Dome in St Louis, Missouri. A shock return for one of the biggest names in the world of sport saw Rousey claim victory after landing the final strike to Charlotte Flair and cap off her return to WWE. With other title belts on the line on the night, Bobby Lashley took advantage of Lesnar’s busy evening — and a surprise attack from Roman Reigns — to reclaim the WWE Championship as the two heavyweights went blow for blow in a monumental evening. Despite his small victory in seeing rival Lesnar lose his title, it was a mixed night for Reigns as he was earlier disqualified from his Universal Championship against Seth Rollins. Meanwhile, Becky Lynch retained her Raw Women’s Championship following a gutsy battle with challenger Doudrop, as The Man continued her rule at the top of the Raw roster. The family drama between Edge and his partner Beth Phoenix against The Miz and Maryse was finally put to bed as The Grit Couple defeated their rivals following a well-timed Glam Slam.
