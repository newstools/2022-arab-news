ADEN: The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center has rolled out aid projects in several countries, including a training course in Yemen covering community treatment for malnutrition. The course, which drew in participants from the governorates of Aden, Lahj, Taiz, Abyan, and Hodeidah, aimed to boost knowledge of nutrition, food components and forms of malnutrition. It was held in collaboration with the International War and Disaster Victims Protection Association. Dr. Mohammed Rajminar, director general of family health at the Yemeni Ministry of Health, stressed the importance of the course, which he said will help alleviate the suffering of Yemeni children.
