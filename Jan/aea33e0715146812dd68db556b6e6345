RIYADH: More than 360 Houthis have been killed in various operations in Yemen, the Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen said on Thursday. In oil-rich Marib province, more than 220 Houthi fighters were killed and 18 military vehicles destroyed in operations over the last 24 hours. The coalition also carried out strikes in Al-Bayda province which resulted in the deaths of over 120 Houthis and the destruction of 13 military vehicles. On Wednesday, the UN envoy to Yemen expressed concern at the Houthi militia’s militarization of ports in Hodeidah. “The accusations of the militarization of the ports of Hodeidah are worrying and the threats of attacking them are equally disturbing given that these ports are a lifeline for many Yemenis,” Hans Grundberg said at a UN Security Council meeting. Several council members condemned the Houthi seizure of UAE-flagged ship Rwabee during the meeting and the UAE's permanent representative to the UN called it a “dangerous escalation.” “We condemn, in the strongest terms, the Houthi act of piracy against the civilian cargo vessel Rwabee off the port of Hodeidah,” Lana Nusseibeh said. “This is a dangerous escalation against the safety of maritime navigation in the Red Sea. It requires the adoption of a firm position by the Security Council,” she added.
