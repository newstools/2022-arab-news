stc pay has launched the “Qattah” service as part of its efforts to enrich the experience of its customers and provide distinctive services that keep pace with their changing needs.
Qattah is an integrated service that allows customers to easily share and track expenses with multiple people, removing the stress from splitting bills.
Through the application, users can equally divide the amount to be collected by specifying a percentage for each person, or by allocating the amount paid by each person separately.
This way of sharing expenses is in line with the goals of Vision 2030, which aims to increase digital financial transactions in the Kingdom to 70 percent by 2030.
The new in-app feature can be found on the list of main services. It allows users to create groups with relatives or friends to buy a joint gift or split a bill.
The Qattah amounts will be automatically processed via the application, providing contactless transactions in line with the Kingdom’s aim of creating a cashless society.
stc pay seeks to build a distinguished mobile digital banking experience for its customers, who number more than 7.4 million, by focusing on a customer-centric approach.
It aims to transform all financial services into contactless digital services, enabling its customers to complete their financial operations conveniently.
