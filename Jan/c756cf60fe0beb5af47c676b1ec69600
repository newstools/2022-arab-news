NEW YORK: The UN Security Council unanimously condemned the Houthi seizure and detention of UAE-flagged vessel Rwabee on Friday.

They also called for a quick resolution to the issue and underscored “the importance of freedom of navigation in the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea, in line with international law.” The council memebers also urged all parties to “stop the escalation of the situation in Yemen,” and to cooperate constructively with the UN Special Envoy toward the resumption of talks to resolve the crisis.
