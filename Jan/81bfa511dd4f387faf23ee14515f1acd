RIYADH: The first hydrogen-fueled racing truck to compete in the Dakar Rally is being sponsored by Saudi oil company Aramco. The truck was developed by Gaussin, a French manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles, and is equipped with tanks carrying up to 80 kg of hydrogen to fuel its 100 percent hydrogen-powered engine. “This is a milestone in the development of hydrogen as a lower-carbon fuel and the first time a hydrogen truck has entered the Dakar Rally,” said Ahmad A. Al-Saadi, senior vice president of technical services, at Aramco. “Through our exclusive sponsorship of the Gaussin H2 Truck, we aim to showcase its potential in the most demanding conditions. Hydrogen has the potential to enable emissions reduction in the transport sector, particularly in segments that are difficult to decarbonize — such as heavy duty vehicles.
