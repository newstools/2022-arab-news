Dr. Issam bin Saad bin Saeed was recently appointed state minister and Cabinet member for the Shoura Council affairs replacing Mohammed bin Faisal bin Jaber Abu Saq, who was appointed as an adviser at the Royal Court.
King Salman issued a number of royal decrees on Thursday to make appointments and replacements in government bodies, mainly the Council of Ministers and the Royal Court.
Bin Saeed has served in the judicial branches as both a legal researcher and assistant to the chairman of the Bureau of Experts at the Council of Ministers, in 1984 and 2003 respectively.
In 2007, he was appointed as chief of the Bureau of Experts at the Council of Ministers. In December 2014, late King Abdullah issued a royal decree assigning him as minister of state and member of the Council of Ministers.
In 2015, he was appointed the interim housing minister and tasked with managing Saudi Arabia’s Real Estate Development Fund, as well as having direct responsibility over the management of residential property within the Kingdom. In April 2016, he was appointed minister of civil service, a position he would occupy until October 2017.
In March 2021, he was named acting minister of Hajj and Umrah by royal decree, succeeding Mohammed Saleh Benten, who was relieved of his duties. In October 2021, former Health Minister Dr. Tawfiq Al-Rabiah took over the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah’s responsibilities, following a royal decree.
Bin Saeed received a bachelor’s degree in administrative sciences from King Saud University and a master’s degree in constitutional law from Cairo University, where he also obtained a doctorate with distinction in public law.
