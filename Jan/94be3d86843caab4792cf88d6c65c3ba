DUBAI: Expo 2020 Dubai is celebrating 10 million visits by offering spectators 10-dirham day tickets on Sunday, Jan. 16, to commemorate the milestone. 
Organizers clarified that the 10-dirham tickets can be purchased online on Friday from 5:00 p.m. or at the Expo 2020 Dubai gates upon arriving at the site, while people with season passes can enter as normal without any additional fees.
The special Sunday event will see the celebration of South Korea’s national day with traditional Jang-Gu drums, a Taekwondo martial arts demonstration and a special K-Pop concert at Jubilee Stage at 7:30 p.m.
With just 11 Sundays of Expo left, the reduced ticket price of 10 dirhams on Jan. 16 will grant those who have not visited the international show an opportunity to do so.
Other events lined up for the rest of the expo include Global Goals Week, running from Jan. 15 until Jan. 22, which will help create awareness of the Sustainable Development Goals. 
It will also celebrate progress made so far and highlight the role of individuals and communities in driving global change for a more sustainable future for all by 2030.
According to a statement released by organizers, COVID-19 safety protocols remain paramount at the Expo 2020 site, with stringent measures in place to ensure the safety of all visitors. 
Visitors will still need to present a negative PCR test result taken within 72 hours or proof of vaccination. Unvaccinated visitors with a ticket can get free PCR tests from select centers across the UAE.
