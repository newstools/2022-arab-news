RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Education has adopted three operational models for the return to classes in primary schools and kindergartens that will come into force from Jan. 23. The models, defined as low, medium and high, will apply to public, private and international institutions, as 97 percent of all schools in the Kingdom fall within the low and medium levels, the ministry said in a statement issued by Saudi Press Agency. The operational models will take into account the health precautions and controls in primary schools and kindergartens in all regions, and will take advantage of the facilities and space available in schools. Low-level schools will ensure complete distancing between students in classrooms and laboratories, while classrooms in medium-level schools will divide students into two groups. High-level schools need to implement distancing in halls and laboratories, and divide students into three groups. The models include psychological and social preparation for students to resume in-person studying, adherence to approved health regulations, monitoring the health status of school staff, excluding classroom and non-classroom activities that fail to achieve physical distancing, equipping classrooms and schools with synchronized broadcasting techniques, and training teachers to manage simultaneous classrooms.
