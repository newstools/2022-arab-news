RIYADH: The Arab coalition said it intercepted and destroyed a drone in Yemen’s airspace that was launched by the Houthi militia toward Saudi Arabia, state TV reported on Tuesday. The coalition said the drone was launched from the capital, Sanaa, to target civilians in the Kingdom. “Attempts to target civilians require an immediate response to deal with the sources of the threat,” it added in a statement. The Iran-backed Houthi militia have been launching near daily cross border attacks against Saudi Arabia, most of which are intercepted by the Kingdom’s defenses or coalition forces. The attacks have been widely condemned by the international community. Later on Tuesday, the coalition announced that it carried out airstrikes on legitimate military targets in response to the threat of the drones from Sanaa and destroyed two drones depots and two workshops for assembling and booby-trapping drones. The coalition said it has taken measures to avoid any collateral damage to civilians and civilian objects.
