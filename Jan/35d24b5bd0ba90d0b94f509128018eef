RIYADH: Secretary-general of the Muslim World League Dr. Mohammed bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa met Janet Alberda, the Netherlands’ ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
They discussed bilateral relations between the two countries and issues of common interest during the meeting.
Relations between Saudi Arabia and the Netherlands were formalized with the opening of a Dutch consulate in Jeddah, which was eventually upgraded to an embassy and moved to Riyadh in 1985.
Dutch exports to the Kingdom include agricultural products and food, while the main imports from Saudi Arabia are plastic, oil and petrochemicals.
