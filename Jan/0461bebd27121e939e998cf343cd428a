RIYADH: German pianist Corinna Simon performed in Saudi Arabia in an event hosted by German Ambassador to the Kingdom Dieter Lamle. A Saudi audience enjoyed a diverse musical program which included compositions by Schumann, Tchaikovsky, Martini and Albeniz.

By age 12, she began training as a junior student at the Julius-Stern-Institut in Berlin. Engagements have taken her to many countries in Europe, the US, Latin America, Asia and Africa. In Berlin, she leads a private training class for highly gifted young people and aspiring musicians. Simon regularly hosts master classes at internationally renowned music academies. The German ambassador marked Simon’s visit to the Kingdom as part of an ongoing cultural program at the German embassy. It includes art exhibitions, music concerts and cinema evenings, bringing the Saudi and the German communities together in Riyadh and Jeddah in support of cultural exchange between both countries.
