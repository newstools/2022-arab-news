DUBAI: In a since-edited post, Vogue France shared a photo of actress Julia Fox wearing a black scarf tied around her head and captioned: “Yes to the headscarf.” For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle Many social media users took to Instagram and Twitter to call out the French fashion publication over the post’s purported “hypocritical” caption as Muslim women in France are banned from wearing the headscarf at work, school and beyond. A post shared by Vogue France (@voguefrance) The outcry comes just days after it was reported that women in France are no longer allowed to wear the hijab during sporting competitions. “The headscarf is fine as long as a Muslim isn’t wearing it right @VogueFrance?” wrote one user on Twitter. Another said: “Yes to headscarves — unless you’re Muslim.” Vogue France captioning Julia Fox wearing a balaclava with “yes to the headscarf” is so hilarious. Yes they changed the caption but …. Yes to the headscarf only when it’s fashion, not when Muslim women protest for their intersectional agency to exist *sigh* — Rehab Mohmed Patel (@PatelRehab) January 29, 2022 Vogue France posting a picture of Julia Fox with a headscarf on and saying “yes to the headscarf” - the same country that banned the hijab — ＪＫ⁷ (@aneeesaaax) January 29, 2022 Vogue fr saying yes to the head scarf julia is wearing but france saying no to the hijab haha funny — (@bellaonthebrain) January 29, 2022
