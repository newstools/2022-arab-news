The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, has done a lot to ensure the stability of the oil market, the Saudi Energy Minister has said. Speaking at the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week Summit on Monday, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman emphasized the importance of a stable market, adding that the Kingdom enjoys good relationships with OPEC+ members. OPEC+ has consistently resisted pressure from countries such as the US to raise oil production plans above the agreed rate of an extra 400,000 barrels a day. Prince Abdulaziz also said that Saudi Arabia is engaging in many events globally with the aim of demonstrating the initiatives taken to boost sustainability. In addition, while the energy sector faces some challenges in terms of technology, the minister said that young people are expected to welcome this with excitement as they try to satisfy their ambitions.
