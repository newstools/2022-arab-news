Al-Arfa’a Fort, located in the northeast of Taif governorate, is a historically significant landmark that details the features of social and cultural life over many centuries.
It was built in the 13th century AH on the historical Al-Arfa’a Mountain, after which it was named.
It is one of the most famous forts in the Kingdom given its major role in trade, where it protected roads for nomads and served as a fortress for military leaders.
The first floor of the three-story fort is built out of stone, while the second and third are built with mud.
The interior is characterized by distinctly organized structures for rulers and their workers.
At the edge of Al-Arfa’a Fort, a mirqab — watchtower — is built in a circular shape and adorned with a crown of pure white quartz.
It contains openings and several wells that provide water throughout the year.
