ABU DHABI: The UAE has grounded most private drones and light sports aircraft used for recreational purposes for a month starting Saturday, the Interior Ministry said, following a deadly attack this week by Yemen's Houthis. While the Interior Ministry did not refer directly to the attack in imposing the ban, it said the decision came after finding misuse of permits granted to those who practice these sports. "MOI (Ministry of Interior) is currently stopping all flying operations for owners, practitioners and enthusiasts of drones, including drones and light sports aircrafts," it said in a statement.  وزارة الداخلية تصدر بياناً تحذيريًا لهواة وممارسي وملاك الطائرات بدون طيار MOI stops drone flying operations for owners, practitioners and enthusiasts#تحذير #Warning pic.twitter.com/YGTjjC4Zlm — وزارة الداخلية (@moiuae) January 22, 2022 Exceptions might be granted by the permit authorities for businesses using drones for filming, the ministry said. The UAE said the Iran-backed Houthi militia used cruise missiles and ballistic missiles alongside drones in the attack on Monday that killed three civilians. The Houthi attack hit a fuel depot of state oil firm ADNOC in Musaffah and a construction site near Abu Dhabi airport, the UAE confirmed while adding it intercepted part of the attack.
