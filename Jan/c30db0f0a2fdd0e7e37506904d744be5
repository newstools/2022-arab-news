DUBAI: The UAE on Monday confirmed 2,629 new coronavirus infections while five more people died from COVID-19 complications. An additional 1,115 individuals have recovered. The country’s caseload stands at 828,328 known confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 2,219 deaths since the pandemic started. The UAE has one of the world’s highest vaccination rates, at 233.98 doses administered per 100 people, with over 23 million vaccines provided so far.
And there has been a marked reduction in daily infection numbers since last week when they topped 3,000. Despite this, health authorities continue the call for residents to adhere to basic health and prevention protocols, including social distancing and wearing masks. The World Health Organization earlier said new infections globally have increased by 20 percent over the past week, with nearly 19 million total reported cases, mostly attributed to the omicron variant.
