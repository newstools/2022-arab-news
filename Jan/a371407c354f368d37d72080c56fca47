RIYADH: Mohammed bin Saeed Al-Jaber, supervisor general of the Saudi Development and Reconstruction Program for Yemen, met Dr. Rola Dashti, under-secretary-general of the UN and executive secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, on Sunday.
During their meeting in Riyadh, the two sides discussed the steps that should be adopted after the issue of the UN report “Least Developed Arab Countries: Challenges and opportunities for Development” in order to strengthen the development partnership and unify development efforts in Yemen.
Dashti said the ESCWA partnership with the SDRPY was a distinguished one that was launched last month after the release of the report “The Arab Least Developed Countries (LDCs): Challenges and opportunities.” These included Sudan, Somalia, Mauritania, and Yemen, said Dashti, adding that Saudi Arabia was a leading party in providing aid to these countries.
She said the report came out with a complete and clear vision regarding the needs of the LDCs in the Arab region for the next decade until 2030. In addition, the meeting discussed ways to contribute to the perceptions and needs of the LDCs, especially Yemen, and how to contribute to activating the development vision and partnership with the international community, considered to be of the utmost importance in achieving these objectives so that Yemen could be safe, and politically, economically, and socially prosperous and stable.
The meeting also discussed the development vision and international partnership to achieve this development vision for Yemen and the Yemenis.
