DUBAI: Saudi Arabia has a good deposit of Zinc, Vedanta Resources’ Anil Argawal said, adding they are looking to invest in exploring this opportunity. Speaking to Arab News on the sidelines of the Future Minerals Forum in Riyadh, the Indian mogul said there will be a “huge demand for Zinc” globally, and only 20 percent of the mineral is being exploited. “We believe that at least 60 percent should still be galvanized,” Argawal, who serves as chairman of one of the biggest Zinc miners in the world, said, in order to realize energy transition goals.
