DUBAI: VMLY&R COMMERCE, WPP’s creative commerce agency, has appointed Nazia Khan to the newly formed role of head of growth for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Khan will work closely with MENA CEO Nick Walsh to enhance the agency’s growth plans and business opportunities by opening new verticals across existing sectors. “We are delighted to welcome Nazia to the team. She comes with a proven track record of driving growth across EMEA and her drive and ambition match strongly with our own,” said Walsh. The agency enjoyed organic client growth in the last quarter of 2021 as online commerce boomed. Khan will work with existing clients to integrate the agency’s creative commerce offering into business plans as well as look to further develop the roster of clients across sectors including FMCG, beauty, automotive, technology, consumer electronics and retail. “We are in a hyper-growth region and the recent explosion of commerce means we need talent like Nazia who can help identify and support clients to reach their goals across the unified commerce landscape,” Walsh added. Khan previously worked at Outform, a global retail agency where she was the business development director for EMEA and managed multi-million sales channels with a focus on retail transformation clients. “VMLY&R COMMERCE is the largest end-to-end creative commerce company in the world and I look forward to engaging clients in the pivotal role that the agency can play in leveraging its powerful creative commerce portfolio to drive brand growth,” said Khan.
