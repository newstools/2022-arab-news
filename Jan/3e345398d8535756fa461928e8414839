RIYADH: The EU has drawn up a financial aid package consisting of emergency loans and grants for Ukraine amid the increasingly tense political situation with Russia. The package entails new micro financial assistance accumulating to €1.2 billion ($1.36 billion), Ursula von der Leyan, the president of the EU commission, said in a statement. It also consists of the doubling of bilateral assistance in grants in 2022 with an additional €120 million to help strengthen the country and its resilient efforts. Tensions in Ukraine have been increasing for months after the Kremlin amassed troops near its borders. The US State Department announced it was ordering diplomats' family members to leave Ukraine.
