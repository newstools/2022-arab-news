TOKYO: Japan will continue to offer assistance that will contribute to the welfare of the people in Lebanon, Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa said at a press conference on Friday. “This is because we consider that peace and stability in Lebanon is extremely important for the Middle East as a whole,” he said in response to a question regarding Japan’s possible contribution to the French-Saudi Fund in support of Lebanon. “We are aware of the press reports that said the UAE will join,” Hayashi said. “At this juncture, the details of the fund have not been made clear,” he continued. With this in mind, he stated that it’s not yet the right time to make any concrete decisions on the matter.
