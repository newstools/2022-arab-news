TUNIS: A new batch of Saudi medical aid, including 160 tons of liquid oxygen, has arrived in Tunis, as part of the Saudi relief airlift.
It was delivered by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center to contribute to the fight against COVID-19 in Tunisia.
The batch was received at the seaport in the Tunisian Rades region by the Saudi Ambassador to Tunisia Dr. Abdulaziz bin Ali Al-Saqr, the Tunisian Acting Minister of Health Ali Merabet, and a number of senior officials.
The Tunisian minister thanked the Kingdom’s leadership for their permanent support for Tunisia. He said that this new delivery of medical aid is an extension of support provided by KSrelief to the health sector and the country’s fight against the COVID-19. Last month, the center delivered 40 tons of liquid oxygen to assist the Tunisian medical sector.
Al-Saqr said that the Kingdom is regularly proving its support for its allies around the world and, today, it is proving to the Tunisian people that it is standing by their side to face all tough circumstances.
He also paid tribute to KSrelief for its strenuous efforts in fighting the pandemic worldwide.
