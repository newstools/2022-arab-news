DUBAI: Key leaders in the region’s mining industry will gather today in Riyadh for a closed-door meeting kicking off the much-anticipated Future Minerals Forum. More than 2,000 attendees are expected to visit the three-day summit, which is set to discuss the future of the mining industry, its organizer the Saudi Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources said. It is taking place at the King Abdulaziz International Conference Center from Tuesday to Thursday, Jan. 13. The first day will also see a mining workshop, alongside other sessions that will explore topics including investments in mining, the role of technology in the industry, as well as sustainability. Mining has been identified as a key economic activity under the Saudi Vision 2030, an ambitious set of national objectives primarily aimed at reducing the Kingdom’s reliance on oil. The event is seen as a platform for the Saudi government to attract investors after an aggressive exploration strategy that led to the discovery of the Kingdom’s mineral wealth.
