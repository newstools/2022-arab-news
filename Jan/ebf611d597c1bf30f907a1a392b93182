CAIRO: Egypt’s Ambassador to China Mohamed El-Badri discussed with Sinovac CEO and founder Weidong Yin accelerating the timetable for transferring COVID-19 vaccine-production technology. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry said they agreed to expedite the building of a central logistical warehouse with a capacity of 150 million vaccine doses, which will strengthen the country’s capabilities as a center for the production and export of vaccines to Africa. El-Badri said this reflects Cairo’s commitment to African countries. Egypt’s Health Ministry said the country plans to produce more than 1 billion doses annually of China’s Sinovac vaccine, making Egypt the largest vaccine producer in Africa and the Middle East.
