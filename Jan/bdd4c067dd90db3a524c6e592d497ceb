TABUK: People in the Kingdom can enjoy a rare snowy escape at Jabal Al-Lawz, or the Almond Mountain, which takes its name from the large number of almond trees growing on its slopes. Rising to more than 2,600 meters above sea level, the snow-capped mountain makes for a perfect winter destination, especially for adventure and nature lovers. Jabal Al-Lawz is located near Saudi Arabia's border with Jordan, above the Gulf of Aqaba.
