NEWCASTLE: Newcastle United have landed in Jeddah for a warm weather training camp a day after registering only their second Premier League win of the season. Last week Arab News revealed that the Magpies will fly to Saudi Arabia following Saturday's match at Elland Road, and Eddie Howe’s team would have landed in Jeddah buoyed by a 1-0 secured courtesy of a Jonjo Shelvey freekick goal. Some fans were on hand to welcome the players and Amanda Staveley, who along with PIF and the Reuben brothers, completed the takeover of the club in October. #NUFC #نيوكاسل Newcastle princess pic.twitter.com/bus44N1CEJ — Saudi Gazza نيوكاسل مع وليد Alwaleed (@Alwaleed_Saudi) January 23, 2022 The squad’s schedule has been kept under wraps so far, but the team is expected to take on Saudi Professional League (SPL) leaders Al-Ittihad in a training match behind closed doors on Friday. The team will return to the UK on Saturday, Jan. 29. #نيوكاسل #NUFC pic.twitter.com/S8GE7rYrEb — Saudi Gazza نيوكاسل مع وليد Alwaleed (@Alwaleed_Saudi) January 23, 2022 Newcastle do not have another Premier League game until they host Everton at St James’ Park on Feb. 8, with next weekend free due to the fact they were dumped out of the FA Cup by lower-league Cambridge United earlier this month. Prior to departure, Howe described the trip to Saudi Arabia as “vitally important” for his team. “Going away will encourage unity,” he said. “It will be a work training camp — we will be training, working and playing a game. I want people to know we are going to be very active.”
