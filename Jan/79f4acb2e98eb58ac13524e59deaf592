DUBAI: Dolce & Gabbana is set to present its Alta Moda, Alta Sartoria and Alta Gioielleria collections via a unique fashion show in Saudi Arabia’s AlUla this January. The heritage site, situated in the northeast of the Kingdom, will play host to the luxury Italian fashion house’s haute couture show on Jan. 27. The forthcoming runway presentation showcasing a range of exclusive couture looks and high jewelry is a part of the AlUla Moments festival season. The event will take place during the Ikmah Fashion Cavalry Show, a special exhibition that celebrates the tradition of Arabian horses, held during Winter at Tantora.   Italian duo Dominic Dolce and Stefano Gabbana presented their label’s Alta Moda, Alta Sartoria and Alta Gioielleria collections in Venice in August. Meanwhile, in 2020, the fashion house unveiled their Alta Moda couture offerings via a digital show due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dolce & Gabbana will also exhibit its one-of-a-kind collection in Maraya, the famed mirrored structure. The exhibition will be open to the public from Jan. 28- 31. Not only will guests have the opportunity to visit the exclusive space, but they will also have the chance to get fitted by the Italian label’s master tailer and shop pieces from the unique collection. The Ikmah Fashion Cavalry Show, conceived and produced by Balich Wonder Studio, is set to wow guests with a full parade of 12 Arabian horses sporting customized horse accessories and attire. Those who wish to attend the Ikmah Fashion Cavalry Show can purchase tickets online on www.experiencealula.com when they go on sale from Jan. 10.
