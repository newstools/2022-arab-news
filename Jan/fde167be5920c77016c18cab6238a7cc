CAIRO: Egypt has condemned the Iran-backed Houthis for targeting southern parts of Saudi Arabia with three armed drones. In a statement, the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the latest launches represented a “flagrant violation of the rules of international law” and were a threat to the security and stability of the Kingdom. “Egypt strongly condemns the Houthi militia’s continuation of its cowardly terrorist attacks toward the lands of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” the statement added. Cairo also pledged its full support for Saudi measures to combat the Houthi attacks, while the Arab Parliament joined in slamming the group for its actions. On Saturday evening, the Saudi-led Arab coalition said in a statement that it had intercepted and destroyed three Houthi drones launched toward the southern region of Saudi Arabia and that intelligence monitoring and operational preparations for air strikes were underway.
