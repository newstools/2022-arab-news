JEDDAH: Saudi municipalities have ramped up health and safety inspections to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the Kingdom. The municipality of Jeddah carried out 6,152 inspection tours of commercial centers and facilities in two days, identifying 47 violations. Authorities closed 22 commercial outlets for breaching protocols. The violations included noncompliance with social distancing and mask-wearing, leniency in measuring the temperature of customers, overcrowding issues, and a failure to effectively use the Tawakkalna app. The app was launched in 2019 to track COVID-19 cases and has been updated to show vaccination information, including an individual’s status — such as vaccinated or infected. It now functions as a COVID-19 “passport.”
