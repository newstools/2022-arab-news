DUBAI: Demining teams in Yemen said the Houthi militia laid 15 mines in the Red Sea of which eight were detected off the coast of Hajjah province, Saba News reported. The teams further destroyed five of the detected mines on Wednesday, the report said. Earlier in December, the coalition said a mine laid by Yemen’s Houthis hit a commercial cargo ship in the southern Red Sea. The coalition said the ship suffered minor damage, but no casualties were reported. The Iran-backed Houthi militia continues to plant mines in the southern Red Sea and in the Bab Al-Mandab strait, which “is a serious threat to international shipping and global trade,” it added. Enter
