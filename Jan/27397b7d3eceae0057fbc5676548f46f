DUBAI: Authorities in the UAE have issued a warning against mocking coronavirus disease (COVID-19) safety protocols on social media. The country’s Emergency, Crisis and Disasters Prosecution at the Federal Public Prosecution said it found several social media posts mocking COVID-19 safety protocols. Some of these posts featured positive test results with video or audio clips calling for the ignoring of isolation and quarantine measures. “In light of the recent circulation of photos and videos on social media spreading information from some COVID-19 patients on the Al-Hosn application, accompanied by comments and songs mocking the precautionary measures and calling on others to flout them, threatening the national efforts to address the pandemic, we, therefore, call upon members of the community to refrain from this behaviour, which is punishable by the law,” said the prosecution’s statement. Spreading false news or misleading information in the UAE is punishable by imprisonment for at least one year and can carry a fine of up to $27,000.
