JEDDAH: The General Secretariat of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation has strongly condemned the attacks perpetrated by armed bandits on villages in Zamfara state in Nigeria. The death toll has reached 200.
The OIC expressed its deep condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and people of Nigeria, and wished the wounded a speedy recovery.
The organization reaffirmed its solidarity with Nigeria in its efforts to combat terrorism and urged the authorities to spare no efforts in bringing those responsible for this barbaric act to justice.
Many residents are angry and frustrated, especially because such attacks by armed groups aren’t rare in northwest Nigeria. In October, gunmen opened fire at a market in neighboring Sokoto and killed more than 40 people.
Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who rode to power in 2015 on a wave of goodwill after promising to end the country’s security challenges, said the latest attack is “an act of desperation by mass murderers now under relentless pressure from our military forces.”
