CAIRO: The Gaza Strip needs “much more” than the $500 million that Cairo allocated to it in May 2021 for reconstruction, said Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. During his participation in the World Youth Forum in the Egyptian city of Sharm El-Sheikh, he expressed hope that reconstruction projects in which Egyptian companies are involved would be completed “as soon as possible for the sake of our brothers in the Gaza Strip.” El-Sisi urged companies operating there to employ Palestinians rather than foreign workers. He also called on donor countries to provide “greater support” to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.
