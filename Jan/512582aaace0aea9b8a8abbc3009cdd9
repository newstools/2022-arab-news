DUBAI: Media agency Mindshare, part of WPP’s GroupM network, has rebranded its official corporate logo as the next step in its transformation process. Deviating from the purple color that had become synonymous with Mindshare, the new logo features a fresh color palette and font including an iteration where the words mind and share are split. In a statement, the agency said that the new brand identity system had been “created to put Mindshare into the heart of the conversation taking place instead of it being a logo stamp found on the back or on the bottom of a communication just to indicate who it is from.” Adam Gerhart, global chief executive officer of Mindshare, said: “Our integrated, client partnership-focused approach to delivering media services for the transformation age demands an identity that is more flexible. “I am excited that we now have a brand identity in place, which supports our strategy and our purpose of accelerating good growth.” NB Studio, a branding and communication agency, was responsible for the rebranding. Mindshare CEO for the Middle East and North Africa region, Tony Bourached, said: “I’m excited for 2022; we have the strong foundation to continue to deliver good growth for our clients, through a passionate team and new products which have been developed globally and regionally to build deeper business insights and tech-led solutions.”
