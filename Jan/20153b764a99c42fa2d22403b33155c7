ADEN: The World Health Organization said its partnership with the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center has helped to improve healthcare services in Yemen. In a report published by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Yemen, the WHO said the collaboration project had provided $20.5 million in funding for health services across the country. Part of the funding had been used to support Lawdar Hospital in Abyan governorate, which handles hundreds of patients every day and offers the only surgical facilities in the area, the WHO added. The report included a statement from the hospital’s director, Dr. Nabil Hussein, who said the financial support from KSrelief and the WHO had been used to provide medical and non-medical equipment and supplies. This included “the therapeutic feeding centers and quarantine units for people infected with COVID-19, in addition to providing medical supplies, medicines, lab equipment, oxygen supplies and medical equipment for targeted health facilities,” he added. The UN report said the collaboration project had helped improve the quality of services at 19 healthcare facilities, which in turn had benefited millions of people. It had also provided fuel and water to 206 other facilities that delivered healthcare to hundreds of thousands of Yemenis. The project had provided CT and MRI equipment that was being used by about 73,000 patients every month, and support for 26 emergency centers that play a pivotal role in tackling COVID-19 in Yemen, it said. Yemen is among the top beneficiaries of KSrelief assistance, receiving more than $3.9 billion. The center, which works with 144 partners from the UN and other international groups, provides a range of programs covering food security, water sanitation and hygiene, health, education, emergency aid and nutrition.
