RIYADH: Health officials urged Saudis on Wednesday to ensure that they were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 after the number of daily cases in the Kingdom more than tripled in four days. Saudi Arabia reported 3,045 coronavirus cases on Wednesday, compared with 846 on Saturday, Jan. 1. The Health Ministry confirmed one new COVID-19 related death on Wednesday, raising the total number of fatalities to 8,886. In a surge in infections fueled by the omicron variant of the virus, the number of new cases has increased almost tenfold in just over a month, from only 34 on Dec. 1. A total of 109 COVID-19 patients are in a critical condition in hospital. The highest number of cases were recorded in the capital Riyadh with 855, followed by Jeddah with 647, Makkah with 398, Hofuf confirmed 152, and Dammam recorded 144. The ministry also announced that 424 patients had recovered from COVID-19, bringing the total number of recoveries in the Kingdom to 543,553. Over 51.9 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered since the Kingdom’s immunization campaign started. More than 23.2 million people have been fully vaccinated. While the omicron variant of the virus is less likely to cause serious illness or death, the MoH urged Saudis to receive a booster shot to avoid acute complications.
