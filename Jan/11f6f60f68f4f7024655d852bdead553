LONDON: Police had named a woman who died Monday as a result of a brutal stabbing on the streets of London as Yasmin Chkaifi. Mother-of-one Chkaifi died alongside her ex-partner, Leon McCaskre, 41, who was hit by a car. Police have said McCaskre stabbed Chkaifi to death and was then hit by a car, killing him. There are reports that the car hit McCaskre in an attempt to stop the attack on Chkaifi. Police confirmed they were both from Maida Vale, London, and had previously been in a relationship. A 26-year-old man arrested at the scene was arrested by police on suspicion of murder, but is said to be cooperating with authorities and has been released on bail. Detective Chief Inspector Neil Rawlinson, of the force’s Specialist Crime Command, said: “We are gaining a clearer idea of what happened at the scene thanks to information supplied by the public and by reviewing CCTV. “Firstly, it is apparent that members of the public bravely tried to intervene to stop the attack and their actions were very courageous. “We are speaking to the families of those concerned and doing all we can to support them at this terrible time. “We can now confirm that both the deceased were previously known to each other and there are no outstanding suspects. “A man, who was the driver of a car, has been arrested and bailed for a very serious offense and we must carry out a full investigation, looking at all the circumstances.”
