DUBAI: Politico Media Group has appointed Goli Sheikholeslami as its new CEO from February 2022. The group includes Politico, its tech news counterpart Protocol and Politico Europe. She will also become chairperson of the shareholder advisory board of Politico Europe, based in Brussels. Sheikholeslami replaces Patrick Steel, who left the company in December. “Goli’s track record is defined by growth, innovation, and a commitment to high-quality journalism,” said Jan Bayer, president of news media at Axel Springer, which owns the group. “With her vast experience and aspiration, Goli was by far our top choice for the role and will further our vision to build the global news and information leader on politics, policy, and regulation in power centers across the world,” he said. Sheikholeslami currently serves as President and CEO of New York Public Radio. She has nearly three decades’ experience in public and private media, including senior leadership roles at The Washington Post, Chicago Public Media, Conde Nast and Time Warner. She also served on the board at NPR from 2016 to 2019 and currently serves on the board of Patreon, the membership platform for artists and creators. Sheikholeslami said: “What I admire most about Politico is the tenacity that underpins the organization’s fearless, fact-based journalism and its successful business model.” “With this strong foundation, no other media organization is better positioned for growth, and I look forward to working with such a talented group of journalists and professionals to write Politico and Protocol’s next chapter.”
