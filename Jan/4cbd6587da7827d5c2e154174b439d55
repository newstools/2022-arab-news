Saudis took to social media platforms to express their excitement and joy at the wintery weather.
“Every year, snowfall brings tourists from across the Kingdom to Tabuk, and while the COVID-19 pandemic will mean fewer visitors than usual this year, some people still drove from as far as Qatar to capture the snow on camera.
A Qatari citizen appeared in a video clip on Twitter from Jabal Al-Lawz, in which he said: “Our people in Qatar did not believe that dazzling snowfall scenes exist in the Kingdom.”
Another wrote: “What a breathtaking scene. The area needs to be developed and the local authorities must use the weather in Tabuk to the country’s advantage. It could be a marvelous attractive destination for tourists not only from inside the Kingdom but also for other GCC countries especially at this time of the year.”
A third wrote: “What a wondrous sight, like something out of Europe. I’m not sure it’s even here.”
The National Center of Meteorology had forecast, in its weather report, that thunderstorms accompanied by strong winds in Asir, Jazan, Madinah, Hail, the northern borders and Al-Jawf, as well as the Tabuk region, where more snow was not ruled out on higher grounds.
