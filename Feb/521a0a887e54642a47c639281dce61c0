The faltering performance of 15-year-old Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva in Thursday night’s long-form routine drew an audience of 10.3 million to NBCUniversal’s Olympic television and digital broadcasts, according to network figures.
The US primetime replay of the skating competition brought in 1.4 million more viewers than the previous night’s Olympics coverage, NBC said.
Valieva, the gold medal favorite in the spotlight after testing positive for a heart drug, made mistakes on her first four jumps and burst into tears at the conclusion of her routine. She finished in fourth place, behind two of her compatriots, Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova, who took gold and silver, respectively.
