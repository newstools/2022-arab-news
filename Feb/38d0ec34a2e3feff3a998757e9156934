LONDON: Spotify Technology’s shares fell 5 percent on Friday after Joe Rogan’s podcast was briefly not accessible on the company’s streaming platform.
The podcast can now be accessed and Spotify did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company has been under fire after Rogan, who signed a $100-million deal with Spotify in 2020, aired controversial COVID-19 views on his show and drew protests from artists Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and India Arie.
Spotify’s Chief Content Officer Dawn Ostroff told advertisers at a conference last week that the backlash around Rogan’s podcast had been a “real learning experience” for the streaming service.
The company’s shares, which have fallen about 59 percent since hitting a record high nearly a year ago, were trading at $151.16 on the New York Stock Exchange.
