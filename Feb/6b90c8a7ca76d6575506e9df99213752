RIYADH: The Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) launched a donation service for the Ehsan platform through the Tawakkalna application. On Wednesday, the authority said that the service aims to harness data in charitable work and expand the impact of Ehsan to reach more beneficiaries through the simple click of a button. The Tawakkalna application now provides a fast and easy donation method to targeted groups through Ehsan services. The donation opportunities available on the application are categorized into three groups: Released, facilitated and other grant projects that cover a wide range of donation options. “There are four simple steps to donate: First, log onto the Tawakkalna application, and then choose to donate with Ehsan. You can then choose the category you wish to contribute to and click donate,” said an infograph on the official Ehsan Twitter account. The Tawakkalna application is an SDAIA initiative originally launched to help the containment of COVID-19 via advanced technology services. Ehsan was set in motion to optimize artificial intelligence and data to encourage developmental projects and sustain their impact through digital solutions. Its primary objective is to assist and catapult the Kingdom’s role in developing charity work, allowing nongovernmental organizations to contribute to Saudi gross domestic product. Due to the generosity and almsgiving of the Saudi public to those in need, the total amount of donations on the Ehsan platform has surpassed SR1.25 billion ($333 million).
