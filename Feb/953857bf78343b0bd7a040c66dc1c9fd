DONETSK: Multiple explosions could be heard on Saturday morning in the north of the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, a Reuters witness said. The origin of the explosions was not clear. There was no immediate comment from separatist authorities or from Kyiv. Meanwhile, Russia's Investigative Committee opened an investigation on Saturday into Russian media reports that a Ukrainian shell exploded in Russia's region of Rostov about 1 km from the border, the law enforcement agency said on its website.
Reports of the incident were carried earlier by Russia's RIA and TASS news agency who cited an unnamed law enforcement source.
