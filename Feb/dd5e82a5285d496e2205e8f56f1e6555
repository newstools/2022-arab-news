LONDON: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit to the UAE will turn a page in bilateral relations between the two countries, the diplomatic advisor to the UAE President said on Sunday. Erdogan will visit the UAE on Feb. 14-15 and will attend the Expo 2020 in Dubai on Tuesday. His visit comes after the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan visited Ankara in November last year. The president’s visit will turn a “new positive page in bilateral relations between the two countries,” and is in line with the UAE's aim to strengthen bridges of communication and cooperation in order to achieve stability and prosperity in the region, Anwar Gargash tweeted. “The UAE continues to strengthen channels of communication with various countries in order to support the stability and prosperity of the region and the well-being of its people,” Gargash said. “The UAE's policy is positive and rational and is in the interests of security, peace and regional development. President Erdogan's visit to Abu Dhabi comes within this framework that we are betting on to ensure a prosperous future,” he added.
