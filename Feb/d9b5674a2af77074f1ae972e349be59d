In an exclusive preview released by publishing company Penguin, the article states that “the Amazigh are dangerous on their best day. They have little regard for anyone who doesn’t worship the Muslim god — and even their own tribes are always at war with one another.” “The representation of Amazigh people in Willow Smith and Jess Hendel’s forthcoming fantasy novel is unacceptable,” wrote one fan on Twitter, while another said: “Why do we get portrayed YET AGAIN as savages?”
