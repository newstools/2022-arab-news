RIYADH: Highlighting the importance of green energy, the UAE energy minister told an energy forum in Riyadh that his country saved $191 billion by using alternative sources.
Speaking at the IPTC 2020 in Riyadh, Suhail Al-Mazroui said the huge saving prompted the UAE to think seriously about using cleaner forms of energy. 
He said the UAE is no longer just an oil producer but also a promoter of green energy.
Al-Mazroui said his country is working on 40 international projects helping other countries implement solar and wind projects.
Talking about the fast-emerging hydrogen market, he said the UAE aims to be part of the market. The Gulf country has plans to capture 25 percent of the global hydrogen market share, he added.
“The UAE is bulling about future of green (energies),” the minister said but stressed the need for investment in fossil fuel with an emphasis on producing low-carbon oil.
