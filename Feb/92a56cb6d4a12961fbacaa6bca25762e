DUBAI: Jennifer Lopez, Owen Wilson, and Maluma star in the upcoming movie “Marry Me,” a romantic comedy about the unlikely marriage between a math teacher and a pop superstar. Over the past few months, the trailer and press release images have shown Lopez wearing a gorgeous Zuhair Murad wedding dress for the onscreen wedding. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle The Ras Baalbek-born couturier and the singer-turned-actress have a long-standing relationship, with Lopez wearing the designer’s creations to countless events and award ceremonies, so when it came to choosing a wedding dress for a pivotal movie moment, it’s not surprising that Murad topped the list. The off-white strapless creation boasts a full skirt and is embellished with glittering pink and gold beading. It is accompanied by an extravagant, shimmering veil to create a full princess bridal look.   Murad isn’t the only Lebanese designer to appear on the screen in recent years. In the original CW series “Gossip Girl,” both characters of Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf wore Arab designers for their on-screen nuptials. Woodsen, played by Blake Lively, wore a metallic gold strapless tulle couture gown by Lebanese designer Georges Chakra, ditching the traditional white bridal look. Meanwhile, her best friend, Waldorf, portrayed by Leighton Meester, wore a light blue lace and embellished Elie Saab couture dress.
