DUBAI: Multi Grammy Award-winning singer Alicia Keys is set to perform for “One Night Only” at Saudi Arabia’s stunning Maraya Concert Hall in AlUla on Feb. 11. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle This will be the first time American singer-songwriter Keys performs in the Kingdom. She will be singing hits from her latest album, “KEYS.” A post shared by AlUla Moments لحظات العلا (@alulamoments) Following her AlUla debut, the US hitmaker will co-host a Women to Women town hall event with Princess Reema bint Bandar Al-Saud, the first female Saudi ambassador to the US, on Feb. 12. The panel will discuss female empowerment initiatives and the overall progress of women in the Kingdom. The two events are presented by Good Intentions, a global creative agency based in Riyadh and founded by Key’s husband Kassem “Swizz Beatz” Dean, a Grammy Award-winning producer, and his Saudi partner, Noor Taher.

The events are part of the AlUla Moments season of events, which run until March 27. Tickets are available on Ticketmaster, and the concert will be broadcasted on MBC and the AlUla Moments YouTube channel.
