Archaeological discoveries and rock inscriptions in Najran created during the early age of Islam are important historical sources to document social life during that time. In addition, they contain evidence of human heritage from thousands of years ago, and are tangible proof of the authenticity of Islamic civilization and the spread of its precious heritage.
In a field tour in the city of Najran, the Saudi Press Agency recorded many ancient archaeological inscriptions and drawings, some of which date back to the early first Hijri century, in the mountains of Al-Zarwaa Al-Darib, Qarn Al-Zaafaran and Al-Markab. The texts vary between poetic verses, Qur’anic verses, preaching phrases, prayers, names of people and other inscriptions written in Musnad, Nabataean, and Kufi scripts. They also demonstrate the civilizational and historical depth of the region during the three centuries that preceded Islam.
The Saudi Heritage Authority is keen to continue its fieldwork to record antiquities and archaeological inscriptions in the region. Almost 200 archaeological and historical sites have been registered in Najran, and excavations are continuing to uncover sites, inscriptions and drawings.
