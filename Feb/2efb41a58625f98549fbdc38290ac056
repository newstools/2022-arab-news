DUBAI: Following a highly successful partnership last year, Lebanese influencer Karen Wazen and Emirati womenswear designer Madiyah Al-Sharqi have again joined forces for a second capsule collection. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle The 1970s-inspired collection features 16 light and playful ready-to-wear looks in a neutral color palette of soft pinks and pastels. For the new offering, Wazen dipped into the archives of Al-Sharqi’s previous collections to choose her favorite pieces before building off of them and adding her own personal touch.   The collection, which is available to shop online on Middle Eastern e-tailer Ounass, is punctuated with feminine and asymmetrical silhouettes. The collection is built off asymmetrical dresses and coordinated sets such as skirts and halter tops, cropped shorts with buttoned short-sleeved shirts, and wide-legged pants with oversized tops. Flowy, flirty, and comfortable seem to be the central themes for the chic capsule collection. Wazen took to her Instagram to launch the collection that will be available online and at a few select stores throughout the Emirates. Writing on the social networking platform, she said: “We’re so excited to share this with you. We hope you love it as much as you loved our first collection.” A post shared by Karen Wazen Bakhazi كارن وازن (@karenwazen) The Dubai-based fashionista is one of the most influential figures in the region, boasting more than 7 million Instagram followers.
