RIYADH: WWE champion Bobby Lashley will defend his title against Brock Lesnar, as well as Riddle, Austin Theory, AJ Styles and Seth Rollins, at the Jeddah Superdome on Saturday, Feb. 19, in the annual Elimination Chamber match. The Elimination Chamber, hosted by the General Entertainment Authority in cooperation with WWE, will take place inside the world’s largest pillarless superdome. It is the first time the annual event has taken place outside of the US. Each match features six participants. Two wrestlers start off in the ring, with another fighter added every five minutes. The winner must eliminate all other competitors. The lineup will also feature Becky Lynch, who faces a tough challenge to retain her Raw Women’s Championship title against WWE Hall of Famer Lita. The first Elimination Chamber match took place on November 2002 at the Survivor Series event in New York City. The match saw Triple H defend his world championship against Shawn Michaels, Chris Jericho, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, and Kane for the World Heavyweight title. Michaels pinned Triple H to win the championship and the first ever Elimination Chamber. The Elimination Chamber then featured in the 2008 and 2009 No Way Out events. WWE conducted a survey of fans in September 2009 and renamed the No Way Out event the Elimination Chamber, which became the title of WWE’s February 2010 pay-per-view event. It was later announced that the Elimination Chamber would become the annual February pay-per-view event for WWE.
