BEIRUT: Lebanese designer Rami Kadi has launched his newest Couture Collection for Spring 2022, entitled “Lucid Algorithms.” For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle The collection comes before the designer is set to debut his first ever non-fungible token collection of the same name. The couture release breaks down barriers between the physical and virtual realms and restructures stigmas around computers and designers. The collection is a human-computer collaboration, in which Kadi created elements that were fed into an algorithm that resulted in an assortment of visuals, that were then used to design and create 40 dresses that make up the new womenswear offering. A post shared by Rami Kadi (@ramikadi) “Lucid Algorithms” is set to be an ode to Kadi’s future endeavors, which center around his beliefs and the metaverse. Kadi is the first Arab designer to delve into the meta verse and the realm of NFTs. The “Lucid Algorithm” NFT collection is also based on the same concept as his couture collection. With the launch, he will lay down a foundation for the future of his couture house and his commitment into the metaverse. His 120-strong NFT collection will be available for purchase on Feb. 2.
