Past will meet present at this year’s WWE Elimination Chamber in Jeddah when hall-of-famer Goldberg and Roman Reigns battle it out for the Universal Championship on Feb. 19. Reigns will look to continue his streak at the top of the WWE, as the man nicknamed “The Head of the Table” has defeated a series of big names on his way to becoming the Universal Champion. It will be a new challenge for the current champion as the recent return of one of the sport’s greatest competitors, Goldberg, will see Reigns compete in his biggest showdown yet. Their previously announced match-up at Wrestlemania 36, which Reigns pulled out of due to health issues, left Goldberg having to bide his time for a shot to take down the Universal Champion. Following his recent return to the ring, it will be a major moment for Goldberg as he looks to put a stop to Reign’s domination of the WWE world. Elimination Chamber will also see Scotland’s Drew McIntire take to the ring with revenge in his sights against Madcap Moss and Happy Corbin. A feud has developed in recent weeks after McIntire had to leave the WWE Day 1 event with severe injuries after a backstage assault by Moss and Corbin, before returning in dramatic style to come close to victory at Royal Rumble.
