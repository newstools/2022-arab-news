In the men’s Elimination Chamber bout, the colossal clash will see WWE Champion Bobby Lashley aim to fend off five of the best in the business, as he takes on Brock Lesnar, Austin Theory, Riddle, AJ Styles and Seth Rollins in the last wrestler standing match to retain his title. The buildup to this year’s Elimination Chamber has been a point of contention, with Lashley taking the title from the controversial Lesnar during their recent Royal Rumble showdown. It was followed by Lesnar demanding a spot at the match in Jeddah. While Seth Rollins earned his spot through his impressive performance at Royal Rumble, Austin Theory, Riddle and AJ Styles emerged victorious from the brutal qualifying rounds to secure a spot in the Chamber and a chance at the WWE Championship belt. Following the title-deciding match between the men, WWE female Superstars Rhea Ripley, Bianca Belair, Liv Morgan, Doudrop, Nikki A.S.H and Alexa Bliss will face off for a chance to challenge WWE Raw Women’s Champion Becky Lynch at WrestleMania 38 in April. All six women wrestlers, each with their own motivations to take on Lynch, will look to finish as the last wrestler standing to earn their spot in the championship showdown at “The Grandest Stage of Them All” in April, with former champions Belair, Ripley and Nikki A.S.H all keen to regain their title.
