RIYADH: Insightful discussions on technology adoption continues on Thursday as Riyadh’s LEAP conference wraps up. The last day of the conference, held at the Riyadh Front Expo Center, will feature another set of A-list speakers from the region and beyond. It picks up from the last two days that saw many tech deals and government announcements from officials such as the Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. In a keynote address, the Prince renewed Saudi Arabia’s commitments to achieving net-zero by 2060, saying the Kingdom will “lead the way on green initiatives.” More high-profile Saudi figures are making an appearance — including Ziad Alyousef, deputy governor for development and technology at the Saudi Central Bank, who will talk about the “evolution of money.” Other speakers include officials from Hyundai, Cisco, Jahez, and Mobily. The last day will also see the grand finale of LEAP’s “Rocket Fuel Start-up Competition,” where 10 startups are presenting to a panel of major global investors and entrepreneurs. Four winners will receive cash prizes of up to $250,000. Follow our coverage.
