RIYADH: Over a dozen Houthi military vehicles were destroyed in strikes on the Yemeni governorates of Marib and Hajjah, the Coalition to Restore Legitimacy said on Wednesday. 14 vehicles were destroyed and a number of Houthi fighters were killed in the 17 strikes that took place over the last 24 hours, the coalition added. On Tuesday, the UN special envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg condemned recent Houthi attacks on the UAE at a UN Security Council meeting on the latest developments in Yemen. He said that Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE “indicate how this conflict risks spiralling out of control unless serious efforts are urgently made by the Yemeni parties, the region, and the international community to end this conflict.” Meanwhile, the Emirati ambassador to the UN criticized the organization for failing to stem the Houthis’ aggression, and the “continued paralysis” of UN-led efforts to bring an end to the war in Yemen. Lana Nusseibeh called on the international community to deal “more firmly and realistically” with the Houthis by imposing further sanctions on them, cutting off their funding, and strictly implementing an arms embargo imposed by the UN Security Council in 2015. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US ambassador to the UN, told the council that the Houthis continue to detain current and former Yemeni staff of the US Embassy and control the embassy’s former compound in Sanaa. She called for their immediate release “unharmed,” adding: “The inescapable conclusion is that we have failed to demonstrate to the Houthis there are consequences for this behavior.”
