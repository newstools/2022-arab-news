RIYADH: The Saudi Food and Drug Authority said it seized more than 2,100 kg of food products from a warehouse in Riyadh that made false claims about the goods’ country of origin. The company was also issued with a penalty in accordance with related regulations, the SFDA said. The authority said it confiscated 2,139 kg of assorted dry food products from the warehouse following a routine inspection to verify its compliance with industry regulations and approved food controls. It said the facility was found to have altered the outer packaging of the seized items to disguise their true origins. The SFDA has the power to take legal action against companies that fail to comply with industry regulations. It urged consumers to report any such violations by calling the unified number (19999) or via the Tammini app.
