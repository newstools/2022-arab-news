DUBAI: Middle East podcast network Rising Giants has announced the launch of two new programs for kids. Titled “RGN AJYAL,” the new segment is aimed at children above the age of 3. “We want to be a positive force in media consumption. One way to do this is to engage kids in beautiful stories that inspire them to listen more, have less screen time and learn their native language,” Basel Anabtawi, the network’s CEO and co-founder, told Arab News. Anabtawi said that although the idea of podcasts for children was new to the MENA region, there was a growing trend for them around the world as parents looked for ways to reduce screen time while keeping their children engaged during the pandemic. A 2020 survey by the US nonprofit Kids Listen found that 16 percent of youngsters had been listening to podcasts for three months or less. Of those who listened, 38 percent were aged 7-8, 35 percent 5-6, and 31 percent 9-10. Almost half of the respondents (49 percent) said they listened to podcasts for fun or entertainment. Rising Giants’ first show for children, “Qosas wa hikayat,” launched on Tuesday and comprises seven episodes that take an immersive storytelling approach. Aimed at children aged 4 and up, the show is narrated in Arabic and promotes the good habits and moral values that are vital to a child’s upbringing and development. The second podcast, “Men Hawlina Aswat,” is set to launch in March and is aimed at children aged 3 and above. It will be narrated in Arabic and voiced by two adults and one child actor. “The interactive show, in conjunction with storytelling, will assist youngsters in identifying and exploring various sets of sounds,” the company said in a statement. Anabtawi said both podcasts were currently free and that Apple Podcast subscribers had early access to them. The shows are available on all major streaming platforms including Apple, Spotify, Deezer and Anghami.
