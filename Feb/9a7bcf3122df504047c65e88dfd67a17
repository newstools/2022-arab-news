CAIRO: Egypt’s Grand Mufti Shawky Allam and Abdullatif Al-Asheikh, Saudi minister of Islamic affairs, call and guidance, discussed strengthening religious cooperation in the face of extremist ideology. “Cooperation between Egypt and Saudi Arabia is the product of historical brotherly relations between the two countries,” said Allam, who met with Al-Asheikh in Cairo. The two sides signed agreements “to confront extremist ideology,” correct “religious concepts distorted by terrorist groups,” and spread “religious tolerance,” Allam added. He said he values the “great efforts” made by the Saudi king and crown prince to serve God and Muslims, citing as an example the management of the Hajj pilgrimage during the coronavirus pandemic. Al-Asheikh stressed that “cooperation between Islamic institutions is important,” and called for Muslim unity in the face of attempts to “spread mistrust among brothers.”
