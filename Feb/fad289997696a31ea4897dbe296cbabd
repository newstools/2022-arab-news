RIYADH: The Saudi Ministry of Health launched a new emergency hotline, Life-Saving Line, which lets Saudis reach specialized teams and medical consultants around the clock. It provides medical guidance to health practitioners and members of the public, coordination on emergency cases and toxicology consultations. Through this service, the ministry is continuing to provide services at the national level to health facilities across both public and private sectors. The Life-Saving Line will involve a team of specialists receiving and sorting calls, and directing callers to specialized consultants to ensure medical decisions are made in record time. In addition, the service allows callers to follow the progress of emergency patients up until their transfer to hospitals and other medical facilities. Teams staffing the hotline can direct callers to a large number of medical specialists covering 12 disciplines.
