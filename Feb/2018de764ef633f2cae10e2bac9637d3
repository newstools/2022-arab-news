RIYADH: A dazzling display of fireworks and drones left Riyadh’s residents spellbound as the grand celebration of the first Saudi Founding Day culminated in style on Thursday. Both citizens and expatriates, some with their families, came together late in the evening to witness the spectacle light up the capital’s skyline. The show was scheduled to start at 10 p.m. sharp, and the large audience started to gather at the venue — the arena on the King Salman Road and Turki Al-Awwal crossing — well in advance. Ahmed Ali, a Riyadh native, who brought his children to see the show, told Arab News: “It was truly amazing, we are happy as our family really enjoyed the 25 minutes of beautiful fireworks and dazzling drones. “We saw such a celebration during the National Day, as we came to know of this show, so we came here and saw this wonderful moment,” he added. Ahmed Yassin, a Jordanian national working in Riyadh said: “It was a spectacular show of fireworks and drones, indeed, a ‘wow’ moment. It was such a captivating and mesmerizing moment. We had great fun and really enjoyed it, and would love to see more such shows in the city. Saudi Founding Day celebration rocks.” Another visitor, Mohammed Serajuddin, who is from India and works at King Saud University, said: “As the huge fireworks combined with drone shows lit up the sky, it was amazing, leaving us spellbound. I just said ‘wow.’ I have never seen such fireworks before. A night to cherish and remember.” Cities across Saudi Arabia hosted a series of events, held from Feb. 22 to 24, to commemorate the first Founding Day, and presented visitors with cultural celebrations of traditional Saudi garments and costumes, and the aroma of traditional Saudi coffee, as the Kingdom’s history unfolded before their eyes. Last month, a royal decree was issued designating Feb. 22 as the Founding Day, to recognize the foundation of the first Saudi state in 1727 by Imam Mohammed bin Saud.
