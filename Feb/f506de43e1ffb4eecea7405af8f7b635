DUBAI: OSN is expanding its slate of NBCUniversal television content, which will see the entertainment hub exclusively premiering more shows and films this year than ever before. Nick Forward, managing director for streaming and chief content officer at OSN, said: “This collaboration strengthens OSN’s premium content portfolio as we deliver to our promise to bring the most sought-after content first, and at the same time as their world premiere, to our viewers. “We are absolutely thrilled to build on our longstanding relationship with NBCUniversal, resulting in some of the year’s most anticipated films and series being added to OSN’s already jam-packed 2022 lineup,” he added. NBCU’s streaming division Peacock launched the original show “MacGruber” last year and it was made available on OSN in December. This year, Peacock Originals such as “Bel-Air,” as well as other Peacock shows including “Angelyne,” “We Are Lady Parts,” and “Joe vs. Carole” will exclusively premiere on OSN in the region. This year will also see OSN premiering Sky Studios’ titles such as “I Hate Suzie,” “Intergalactic,” and “The Fear Index” and NBC titles including “The Thing About Pam” and the new “Law and Order,” with the latter two launching on the same day as their US premiere. Don McGregor, executive vice president and head of worldwide distribution at NBCUniversal, said: “The caliber and breadth of content we have to offer clients around the world is something that we’re extremely proud of. “OSN has been a great partner to us throughout the years and we are delighted that their subscribers will soon be able to enjoy NBCUniversal’s exciting, new series and films.”
