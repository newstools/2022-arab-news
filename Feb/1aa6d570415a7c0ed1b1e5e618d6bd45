ANKARA: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan stressed the importance of who Libyans choose in eventual elections when asked about that country’s parliament assigning a new prime minister, broadcaster NTV and others cited him as saying on Wednesday.Turkey has provided military support and training to Libya’s former internationally recognized Government of National Accord, and helped it fight off an assault lasting several months on the capital Tripoli by eastern Libyan forces led by Khalifa Haftar. It still has military personnel and fighters in Libya.Last week, the Parliament spokesman declared Fathi Bashagha the new interim prime minister after a rival candidate withdrew, but it was not clear if the chamber had held a vote. Incumbent Abdulhamid Al-Dbeibah has said he does not recognize the attempt to remove him and will not step down.“Fathi Bashagha announced his candidacy. Our ties with Fathi Bashagha are good. On the other hand, (ties) are also good with Dbeibah,” Erdogan told reporters on a return flight from Dubai. “The important thing is who the Libyan people choose and how,” he was cited as saying by Turkish media.He also said an assassination attempt on Dbeibah last week was “saddening.”
