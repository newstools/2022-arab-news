JUBAIL: Jubail Commercial Port and the National Industrialization Company (Tasnee) held a workshop hosting leading Jubail-based industrial companies and major shipping lines to discuss collaboration opportunities and initiatives promoting the export of petrochemicals through the port.
The workshop also discussed proposals to supply empty containers at the port, increase the port’s share of outbound containers owned by Jubail-based manufacturers to save on time and cost, and reduce the carbon footprint of traffic congestion caused by trucks transporting goods and cargo to other seaports, the Saudi Press Agency reported.
People attending the workshop expressed their support for all initiatives that facilitated investment and agreed to hold meetings between manufacturers and shipping lines to assess the level of cooperation between both parties.
Jubail Commercial Port is equipped to receive vessels of all types and sizes.
It is instrumental in the efforts of the Saudi Ports Authority to develop a sustainable and prosperous marine sector and transform the Kingdom into a global logistics hub, in addition to realizing its social and economic ambitions.
