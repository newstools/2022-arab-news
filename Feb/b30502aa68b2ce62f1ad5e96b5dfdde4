RIYADH: Al-Shabab FC got back to winning ways after overcoming hosts Al-Feiha 2-1 at Al-Majmaa Sports City Stadium on Sunday, in the conclusion of the 22nd round of the Saudi Pro League season. The result keeps the Riyadh club in third place in the SPL table on 43 points, one behind second place Al-Nassr — who have played the same number of matches — and eight behind leaders Al-Ittihad, who have a game in hand on their rivals. Al-Feiha fell to eighth place with 27 points. After Cameroonian John Marie opened the scoring in the 41st minute, Al-Feiha equalized through Abdulrahman Al-Sefri on 58 minutes as the hosts regained a measure of control in the match. But Al-Shabab kept their slim hopes of SPL title glory alive with a winner from Nawaf Al-Abed 10 minutes from the end. Al-Shabab will next host Al-Batin on Saturday, while Al-Feiha will visit Al-Raed the same day.
