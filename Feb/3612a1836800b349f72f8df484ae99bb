RIYADH: Wally, the personal finance mobile app, announced on Tuesday that it has recorded a 135 percent year-on-year growth in global users. It also said it had increased a 30 percent compound monthly increase in bank-connected users in the UAE, helping people track 670,000 accounts. The UAE has been Wally’s fastest-growing market since introducing the ability to allow users to link their bank accounts to the app in May 2021. The uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic forced many residents in the UAE to reconsider how they spend their money and leverage the personal finance app’s features. Wally allows users to sync their savings, checking, credit card, and loan bank accounts to the app. “Now more than ever, people are wanting to be in control of their finances, the challenge is they don’t know where to start. Wally’s value proposition is it eliminates the guesswork and anxiety related to managing money and instead provides users with valuable insights anywhere and at any time,” Saeid Hejazi, Co-founder and CEO of Wally said.
