JEDDAH: The Muslim World League is preparing to host the International Fair and Museum of the Prophet’s Biography and Islamic Civilization at the Islamic World Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s headquarters in Rabat, capital of Morocco. The event, under the patronage of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, the King of Morocco, coincides with the celebrations of Rabat as the cultural capital of the Islamic World for the year 2022. The exhibit, whose headquarters is in Madinah in Saudi Arabia, is receiving great interest in the biography of the Prophet. It has been visited by presidents, kings, princes and prominent figures, who have praised it as an international Islamic landmark that is rich in civilization and humanity. Working in collaboration with ICESCO and the Muhammadiyah Association of Scholars in the Kingdom of Morocco, the MWL agreed to establish branches for the museum in a number of Islamic countries.
