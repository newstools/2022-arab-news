DUBAI: Several European parliamentarians have reportedly stressed the importance to blacklist the Houthi militia as a terrorist organization due to their violations against civilians and for storing weapons in non-military facilities. On Wednesday, Yemen’s state news agency, SABA, reported that talks took place during a virtual seminar organized by the center-right bloc in the European Parliament (EPP Group). During the meeting, European MPs said the Houthis used civilians as human shields, stocked weapons in residential complexes, schools and hospitals and had turned Sanaa airport into a military base. As such they said they would continue to push for the classification of the Houthi militia as a terrorist organization. EU Parliamentarian, Lusia Regmenti, also highlighted the Houthi militias' crimes against women and girls. Regmenti urged the EU to protect young girls and support children’s education in the war-torn country.
