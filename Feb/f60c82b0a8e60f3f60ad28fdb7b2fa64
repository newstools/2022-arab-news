RIYADH: The Saudi Food and Drug Authority has identified 19 facilities found during January to be in breach of laws relating to pharmaceutical establishments and failing to provide products to the local market. Officials pointed out that pharmaceutical factories and warehouses were obliged to stock enough quantities of all authority registered products to meet local demand for a period of six months and flag up any supply shortages or interruptions. Authority inspectors detected 28 outlets that were not registered on the drug tracking and tracing system, and 18 facilities that had failed to promptly report drug movements. The authority monitors stocks of pharmaceutical and herbal products registered with it in factories and warehouses, and their trade throughout Saudi Arabia, via the electronic system, with the aim of maintaining sufficient stock levels and ensuring the commitment of all stakeholders in the drug supply chain. It also takes legal action against violators.
