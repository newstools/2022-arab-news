Google has announced that Lino Cattaruzzi, its managing director for the Middle East and North Africa, will be leaving the region to take on a company leadership role as global customer partner. Cattaruzzi has been with the technology firm for 13 years, leading the MENA business and operations since 2016. During that time, he has grown the regional business and presence through office expansions. Anthony Nakache, who will take over as MD for Google MENA based in Dubai, joined the business 13 years ago and most recently headed the online partnerships group responsible for scaling Google’s monetization solutions for publishers and developers throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Prior to that, he led sales and account management for strategic partners at Google, namely in gaming and media agencies in France, southern and eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Before moving to Google, Nakache worked in IT consulting and gained a master’s degree in business administration from INSEAD, and an engineering degree in telecommunications. He told Arab News: “I’m very pleased to continue my journey with Google and lead its business and operations in the Middle East and North Africa. “There are so many opportunities in MENA to unlock, from helping more people access the information and knowledge they seek through products like Search and YouTube, to helping local businesses, developers, publishers, and creators grow and succeed in the new digital economy. “Google is deeply committed to the region through continued investments and partnerships, and I’m excited to be a part of that,” Nakache said.
