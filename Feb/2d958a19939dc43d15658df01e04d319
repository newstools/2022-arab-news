PRISTINA: Kosovo has asked the United States to establish a permanent military base in the country and speed up its integration into NATO after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Kosovo’s Defense Minister Armend MeHajj said on Sunday.
The United States has already 635 soldiers in the Balkan country to maintain the fragile peace as part of a NATO peacekeeping mission.
“Accelerating Kosovo’s membership in NATO and having a permanent base of American forces is an immediate need to guarantee peace, security and stability in the Western Balkans,” MeHajj said on his Facebook page.  This is the time when all responsible nations have to act united in our joint vision for peace. I once again reiterate the call for the USA to establish a permanent military base in Kosovo to strengthen peace & stability in the region & beyond. — Armend Mehaj (@armend_mehaj) February 27, 2022 Kosovo has joined other countries in introducing sanctions against Russia. MeHajj has said that his government was ready to offer help for any military operation to Ukraine, should that be asked for by Washington.
Kosovo’s 2008 independence is recognized by more than 110 countries, mainly Western nations, but not by Serbia or its traditional ally Russia. Four NATO members also refuse to recognize Kosovo’s independence.
Kosovo is still not a United Nations member over objections from Russia.
