ABU DHABI: The second-round action of the FIFA Club World Cup UAE 2021 will kick off with a meeting between the continental champions of CAF and CONMEBOL as Al-Ahly face Monterrey at the Al-Nahyan Stadium on Saturday. Both teams boast passionate fan bases and are expected to attract major support as they begin their respective bids for a first title. Al-Ahly should benefit from a strong Egyptian expatriate community in the UAE, which is among the biggest in the country. “We are confident Al-Ahly fans in the UAE will be there to back us tomorrow just like they’ve always done,” said captain Ramy Rabia. “They will play an important role.” Spectators supporting the 10-times CAF Champions League winners should help make for a raucous atmosphere as Al-Ahly appears in the FIFA Club World Cup for a seventh time, looking to improve on their previous best of third-place finishes in 2006 and 2020. Standing in their way first is Monterrey, the 2021 CONMEBOL Champions League winners from Mexico, who are competing in the tournament for a fifth time. The Rayados have an equally passionate fan base, and plenty will follow them from South America, bringing the color and passion that makes football across the continent one of the most revered in the world. Fans without tickets and other visitors can enjoy activities at the ground’s fan zone. Al-Ahly assistant coach Sami Elsoudany said: “We thank the UAE for the amazing welcome. This exceptional standard of organization is what we are used to from this great country.” Strict COVID-19 measures are in place to ensure a safe environment during the tournament.
