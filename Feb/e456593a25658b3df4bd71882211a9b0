RIYADH: Huge explosions from Russian attacks on oil and gas installations lit up the night sky in Ukraine early on Sunday, while Western allies tightened sanctions to banish major Russian banks from the main global payments system. Ukrainian forces were holding off Russian troops advancing on the capital Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said as the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two entered a fourth day. But the night was brutal, with shelling of civilian infrastructure and targets including ambulances, Zelenskiy said. #RussiaInvadedUkraine #StopPutin pic.twitter.com/Fbi81teeHi — Ukraine / Україна (@Ukraine) February 26, 2022 Russian flights ban A European Union-wide ban for Russian flights could be part of a fresh package of sanctions on Moscow to be discussed later on Sunday by the bloc's foreign ministers, Reuters reported, citing an EU official. A vast majority of EU member states have already closed their airspace to these flights, and a more formal decision could be taken shortly, the official added.
