LONDON: The Gulf Cooperation Council urged all parties to the Russia-Ukraine conflict to be calm and use peaceful means to find a solution on Wednesday. Speaking at a UN General Assembly on behalf of the GCC, Saudi Arabia’s deputy permanent representative to the UN said member countries are “worried” about developments in Ukraine and that the organization supports deescalation efforts. Mohammed Abdulaziz Alateek said the GCC is in favor of international law, and the UN charter, particularly the principle of peaceful settlement of dispute, the-non use of force or the threat of use of force, and the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. The GCC called for dialogue, diplomacy, and the implementation of Security Council resolution 2202, he added. Meanwhile, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the body that “our world is facing a moment of peril” over the crisis. “If the conflict in Ukraine expands, the world could see a scale and severity of need unseen for many years,” he said. “It is time for restraint, reason and de-escalation,” Guterres added, stressing there was no room for actions or statements that would ”take this dangerous situation over the abyss.” The warnings were made during an annual General Assembly session on “temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories.”
