BEIRUT: Amos Hochstein, US envoy for energy affairs, arrived in Beirut on Tuesday to look into ways to resume Lebanese-Israeli maritime border demarcation talks that have been stalled since November 2020.
Arab News learned that Hochstein is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati along with other officials.
It is noteworthy that Wednesday is an official holiday in Lebanon, and officials are scheduled to participate in a Christian celebration.
The country is awaiting ideas from Hochstein to find a way to resume indirect negotiations hosted by the UN Interim Force in Lebanon.
One of the issues that needs resolving is the disputed Qana gas field, which is included in the licensing round that Lebanon has launched for drilling and exploration companies to start bidding on. Negotiations reached a stalemate only one month after their launch in October 2020.
