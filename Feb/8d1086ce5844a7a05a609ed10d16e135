JEDDAH: Saudi municipalities are continuing health and safety inspection tours to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the Kingdom. The municipality of Jeddah carried out 5,654 visits to commercial centers and facilities in two days, identifying 21 violations. Field teams closed seven commercial outlets for breaching COVID-19 health protocols. The Eastern Province municipality carried out 1,036 inspection tours in one day, identifying 89 violations. Authorities closed one commercial outlet for breaching health regulations. Violations included noncompliance with social distancing and mask-wearing, leniency in measuring the temperatures of customers, overcrowding issues and failure to effectively use the Tawakkalna app. The app was launched in 2020 to track COVID-19 cases and has been updated to show vaccination information, including an individual’s status, such as vaccinated or infected. It now functions as a COVID-19 “passport.” The municipalities called on commercial facilities to abide by regulations to ensure public safety and prevent the spread of the disease. Officials have urged the public to report any suspected health breaches by phoning the 940 call center number or by contacting authorities through the Balady app.
