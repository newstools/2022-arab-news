LONDON: Russia has criticized Israeli settlement expansion plans in the Golan Heights. “We’re concerned over Tel Aviv’s announced plans for expanding settlement activity in the occupied #GolanHeights, which contradicts the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention,” the Russian mission to the UN tweeted. “Russia doesn’t recognize Israel’s sovereignty over Golan Heights that are part of #Syria.” Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and annexed the territory in 1981, in a move not recognized by the international community. A resolution by the UN Security Council, of which Russia is a permanent member, states: “The Israeli decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights is null and void and without international legal effect.” Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announced plans late last year to double the number of settlements in the territory.
