Saudi Cup winner 2022... 17:00 - Yoshito Yahagi, trainer of Stay Foolish, who won the third race of the day said: “I have been a trainer for a long time and this is one of my happiest moments. “I thought before he could win, absolutely. I knew he was training well so we had some confidence before the race. He is a one-paced sort of horse so this distance of 3000m must help him. “To lead was one of our tactics and I depend on Christophe [Lemaire] to decide what is best in the race; I trust him. It is a great day for Japanese racing, proving how strong it is. Looking forward, I hope we can go to Australia for the Melbourne Cup later in the year.” 16:30 - In the penultimate race of the day on the dirt, Dancing Prince takes the honors, and Good Effort claims second with Chain Of Love third. 16:00 - We're getting closer to the big race, but in the Saudi Derby Pinehurst takes the glory, with Sekifu in second and Consigliere in third. 15:30 - In the Obaiya Arabian Classic, Hadi De Carrere takes first, with Tilal Al Khalediah in second and RB Rich Lyke Me third. #LIVE: Crowds enjoying the action at the @thesaudicup ahead of the big race. #SaudiCup2022 https://t.co/CKSx50v4RX pic.twitter.com/45lLTz3me0 — Arab News (@arabnews) February 26, 2022 15:00 - Aan Alawaan takes first, Okku second and Kather third in The Jockey Club Local Handicap, in race four.
