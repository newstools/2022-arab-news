RIYADH: The Arabian Leopard has been chosen as the mascot of the first Saudi Games, the event’s organizers said Thursday. The Saudi Games 2022 will run from March 10 - 20 in the host city Riyadh. The mascot includes the games logo with three colors of the Arabian leopard, and organizers are asking sport fans to help name the mascot. The organizing committee chose the Arabian leopard as part of the campaign to increase awareness and prevent the extension of the animal, a statement said. In addition, the choice of mascot will also help define the goals of the Global Arabian Leopard Fund to the public and promote the cause, especially after the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warned the animal is a critically endangered species, the statement added. According to The Royal Commission for AlUla Governorate, in September 2021 a new female Arabian Leopard was born. In addition, to raise more awareness, the Council of Ministers marked February 10th as Arabian Leopard Day.
