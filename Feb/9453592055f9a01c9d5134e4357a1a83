JERUSALEM: Prosecutors in the high-profile corruption case against former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that police have found no unlawful use of phone surveillance technology against witnesses in the trial. The state attorney’s response to the court came a week after an Israeli newspaper report alleged that police used spyware to hack the phones of numerous former ministry directors, mayors, and protest leaders. Among the alleged targets were a key state witness in the trial against Netanyahu and some of the former prime minister’s close aides. The prosecutor’s office told the Jerusalem District Court that police officials who looked into the matter did not find any cases of surveillance without a court order in the three corruption cases involving Netanyahu. It asked the court for additional time for a probe conducted by the attorney general’s office to investigate the allegations more comprehensively before responding. Netanyahu is on trial for alleged fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases.
