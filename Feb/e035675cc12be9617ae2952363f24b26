Al-Moanis village Dhahran Al-Janub governorate, located 150 km southeast of the city of Abha, is characterized by its traditional villages and their architectural style.
One of these villages is Al-Moanis village, which is known for its variety of castles and forts, with some being six-stories high. This has become one of the site’s features that attract visitors.
The village comprises an upper part known as “Haydan” and a
lower part known as “Dar Al-Arak.” They are located at the edge of Wadi Al-Areen, one of Dhahran Al-Janub’s largest valleys.
Between the two parts, you can find “Aatef Al-Moanis.” It is a site famous for its farms that grow different kinds of grains, from corn to wheat and barley, along with its pomegranate, fig, grape and citrus fruits orchards.
Al-Moanis is considered one of Asir province’s oldest villages. It has about 100 houses, most of which are castles. They are surrounded by a high and solid fortress made of stone and mud.
