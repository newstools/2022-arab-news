ABU DHABI: The UAE has announced that it will lift a travel ban on its vaccinated citizens to travel to twelve African countries, state news agency WAM said on Friday. The countries include Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, the Republic of Congo, South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. The ban will be lifted from 6 p.m. on Feb. 6, WAM said. The General Authority of Civil Aviation and the National Emergency, Crisis and Disaster Management Authority said anyone who has received both doses of a vaccine and a booster shot will be able to travel to the destinations from this date. Authorities said it was imperative all those planning on traveling to the countries abided by all precautionary measures and followed health guidelines, including social distancing, the wearing of face masks and regular handwashing. Restrictions had been placed on travel to the African countries in November and December following the surge in cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
