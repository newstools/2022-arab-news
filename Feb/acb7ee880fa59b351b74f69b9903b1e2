DUBAI: Moroccan-British model Nora Attal took multiple turns down Nensi Dojaka’s runway show during London Fashion week. The 22-year-old fashion star strutted down the runway wearing two different mesh cut-out dresses that have become synonymous with the British-Albanian designer’s sensuous brand. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle Dojaka, who won the prestigious LVMH Prize in 2021, unveiled her Fall 2022 ready-to-wear collection on Saturday. Much like her previous offerings, the new collection featured tailored jackets, see-through dresses and hosiery that stay true to her brand’s identity. It also boasted versatile pieces that cater to a much wider audience, including puffer jackets and knitwear.   For Attal’s first turn down the catwalk, she wore a predominantly black mini dress with multiple cutouts around the shoulders, torso and chest. The look also featured mesh fabric accents on the chest and arms. Her second look, similar to the first, featured a brown and maroon mesh cut-out dress. The British-born model is a house favorite, walking for Nensi Dojaka’s Spring 2022 ready-to-wear collection back in September. Attal is currently one of the most sought-after models in the industry. She grew up in Britain with Moroccan parents and made her industry debut with a campaign for J.W. Anderson in 2014. Since then, she has graced multiple runways and campaigns around the world for major fashion houses.
