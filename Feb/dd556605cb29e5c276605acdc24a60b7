RIYADH: The Diriyah Gate Development Authority has signed a deal with the Saudi Arabian National Committee of the International Council on Monuments and Sites to preserve cultural and natural heritage sites in the Kingdom. The partnership will particularly focus on protecting the UNESCO World Heritage Site in Diriyah’s historic At-Turaif district, as well as preserving other yet-to-be-identified locations. It will also help elevate the level of coordination and cooperation between the DGDA and Saudi ICOMOS committee, enhancing their efforts to preserve heritage sites in line with ICOMOS and UNESCO best practices and conventions. Both organizations will conduct specialized scientific research on culturally significant areas in Diriyah and formulate joint recommendations to preserve the values and characteristics of the sites. The memorandum of understanding was signed by the DGDA’s chief executive officer, Jerry Inzerillo, and the Saudi ICOMOS president, Princess Nouf bint Mohammed bin Fahd.
