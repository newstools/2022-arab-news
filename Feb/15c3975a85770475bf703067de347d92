RIYADH: UAE’s cabinet of ministers approved a decision to allow cooperative associations to trade their shares in financial markets, Emirates news agency WAM reported. As per the new decision, stock markets will establish special platforms for registering, trading and transferring the ownership of cooperative association shares, so they are independent from general trading platforms in the market. The move aims to strengthen the regulatory environment of the cooperative sector and raise its competitiveness, through enabling them to raise funds needed to expand and diversify their activities.
