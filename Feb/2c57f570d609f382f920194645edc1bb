CAIRO: Egypt establishes relations on the basis of mutual respect and common interests but never on the basis of conditionality, said Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Saturday.
“Egypt has confirmed that on many occasions,” Shoukry said, adding his country also establishes relations on the basis of non-interference in the internal affairs of countries and in accordance with the rules and charter of the United Nations and international norms.
His comments were made at a joint press conference with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock following bilateral talks during her first visit to Egypt .
He added that Egypt resorted to Germany to fulfill its needs for armament in order “to protect its national security and borders.”
Shoukry emphasized that a “militarily strong Egypt” has contributed to achieving further security and stability across the region and Europe.
He further praised the Egyptian navy’s efforts in combating illegal immigration to Europe since September 2016, a matter which is of high concern to the Europeans. The armament has also enabled Egyptian security forces to combat terrorism.
Meanwhile Birbock said Germany is in the process of setting a restrictive policy on exporting German arms to countries from which it imports weapons, and a law is being legislated.
