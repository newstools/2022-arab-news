During the meeting at the headquarters of the OIC General Secretariat in Jeddah, the two sides discussed ways and means to consolidate the relations of cooperation between Gabon and the OIC, and to promote joint Islamic action.

During the meeting, the OIC secretary-general and Gabon’s ambassador reviewed stability issues in many parts of Africa, and discussed the organization’s role in promoting peace and security on the continent.
