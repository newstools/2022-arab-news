RIYADH: King Abdulaziz Public Library launched mobile library buses on Tuesday to celebrate Founding Day. The buses carry large collections of books and other material that document the country’s history over three centuries and the formation of the Saudi state throughout different eras. King Abdulaziz Public Library participated in several activities on Feb. 22, including the bus launch, said its general manager Bandar Al-Mobarak. “We want to make a national project to connect people more with books, and we aim to familiarize the citizen and resident with important aspects, whether cultural, knowledge or historical aspects,” he told Arab News. “And this is what we saw through the great turnout from the people who entered our buses. Our goal on Founding Day is to introduce citizens and residents to important glimpses of our glorious history by displaying many manuscripts, anecdotes, and books by travelers and orientalists that monitored Saudi history.” The mobile library is a two-story bus, with each vehicle having shelves that can accommodate 3,000 books and other informative material, divided into several sections. The archive includes specialist sources of knowledge that cover the founding stages of the Kingdom and a few very rare manuscripts. It  has the Abbas Pasha I manuscript, which deals with the origins of horses in Saudi Arabia, and the Ibn Bishr manuscript, which deals with the history of the country's foundation and monitors several developments and historical facts. It also offers other sources of knowledge on Saudi history. The mobile libraries include places for reading and viewing and provide specialist, high-quality books. They seek to deliver reading and research services to all regions and cities of the Kingdom and participate in national events, cultural festivals, and exhibitions.
