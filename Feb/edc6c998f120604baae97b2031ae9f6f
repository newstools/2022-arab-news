LONDON: The Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen said on Tuesday it had launched 23 operations targeting the Iran-backed Houthi militia in the Yemeni province of Hajjah.
The coalition said it had inflicted losses on the Houthis and destroyed 11 military vehicles, Saudi state TV reported.
Meanwhile, the coalition said early on Tuesday that it had carried out an operation in Al-Bayda governorate and destroyed military targets, in response to a threat.
“To protect civilians from hostilities, we will continue to carry out massive air strikes,” it said.
