The changes aim to improve the environment in order to enhance residents’ quality of life, as studies have shown a direct correlation between the two. In parallel, government entities in Dubai have implemented programs that will help enhance environmental protection and resource conservation. These include integrated waste management strategies for the emirate; reducing harmful fishing practices such as banning the use of nets; and the enforcement of fees for waste disposal, which was implemented at the beginning of the year. The Dubai Government has also invested in several projects aimed at turning waste into resources. The general public has also been encouraged by government officials to practice waste segregation and disposal.
