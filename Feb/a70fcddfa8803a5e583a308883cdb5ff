DUBAI: Meta has promoted Fares Akkad to the role of regional director for the MENA region. From March 1, Akkad will lead the commercial growth of the company and its portfolio across the region. Akkad joined Meta in 2017 as head of media partnerships for Facebook and Instagram, Middle East, Africa and Turkey. Most recently, he was the director of media partnerships for news in growth markets at Meta, where his role was to support journalists and publishers. Prior to Meta, Akkad led digital business development and distribution for MBC Group. He is also an active advisor and investor in the startup scene. “The impact of the Middle East and North Africa region — from its wealth of communities, startups, partners and people who actively use our platforms to do good, everyday — cannot be overstated and needs someone with both in-depth regional and industry knowledge and expertise to allow it to reach its full potential,” Derya Matras, vice-president, Middle East, Africa and Turkey at Meta, said in a statement. “The global and regional experience that Fares brings, within Meta and otherwise, is going to be a catalyst that will serve to drive our business forward and foster an environment that allows our platforms to be a place of positive growth and impact, as we continue to build toward the Metaverse,” he added. Akkad said: “I am honored and excited to be able to work with the rest of the incredible Meta team in MENA to help further embed the importance of this transformation and afford people throughout the region every opportunity to create, succeed and grow.”
