MADINAH: The red carpets used to pray on by worshippers in the courtyard of the Prophet’s Mosque in Madinah have been replaced with 12,000 new green ones. Sheikh Abdul Rahman Al-Sudais, general president of the Affairs of the Two Holy Mosques, inaugurated the new acrylic carpets. The carpets are made locally according to accurate technical standards with the comfort of worshippers in mind.   They are characterized by their thickness and durability for heavy use, in addition to having plenty of soft wool and fixed colors that do not run after being washed. Each carpet has an electronic chip that is connected to a system containing information regarding its manufacture, use, location and wash times. Data may be printed on a barcode that allows for the carpets to be traced and their information accessed easily.
