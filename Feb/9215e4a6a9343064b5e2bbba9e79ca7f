DUBAI: Saudi Arabia’s pavilion at Expo 2020 Dubai continues to enthrall visitors with its diverse set of activities, most recently the “16 Windows” cultural program that sheds light on the cultural renaissance in the Kingdom in various sectors. The Kingdom’s pavilion presented a historical overview of its ancient heritage art, and introduced visitors to the Saudi Ardah, a tradition group dance that is featured on UNESCO’s List of Intangible Cultural Heritage. The performance started with a chant that was used in the past to rouse up warriors facing the enemy. The performers, dressed in traditional costumes, then performed a dance with swords to the beat of drums. The leader of the Ardah troupe then invited men and women from the audience — from Ireland, Tunisia, UAE, Russia, France and India — to join the performance. The lead performer offered the visitors a quick introduction to the dance, amid cheers from the audience. At the end of the show, the pavilion presented gifts to the best participants in the performance of this ancient heritage art. They expressed their happiness with this beautiful experience that allowed them to participate.
