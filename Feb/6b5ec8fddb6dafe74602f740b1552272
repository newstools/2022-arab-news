The month-long exhibition will take place at the Dubai Fountain adjacent to the Dubai Mall from Feb. 4 to March 7. The showcase brings together a remarkable collection of contemporary looks, early twentieth-century trunks, artistic collaborations and iconic leather creations from the heritage house.   SEE LV will allow visitors to explore the world of Louis Vuitton through immersive and interactive digital experiences. After being greeted by a portrait of young Louis Vuitton, conceived by artist Refik Anadol using artificial intelligence, visitors will enter a room featuring a reverse-chronology selection of men’s and women’s ready-to-wear pieces. An exquisite gown by British fashion designer Charles Frederick Worth stands alongside a historical 1906 trunk, illustrating the label’s long standing relationship with fashion. The exhibition then presents a wall of Louis Vuitton’s most iconic bags and images of their celebrity friends, including Alicia Vikander, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and Regina King, among others. The showcase will also have a room dedicated to Louis Vuitton’s major contributions to the invention of luggage typologies, ranging from the iconic Wardrobe trunk to 2020’s Louis Vuitton 2054 raincoat-tent.
