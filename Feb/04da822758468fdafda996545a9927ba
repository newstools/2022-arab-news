RIYADH: Strong oil market has urged Aramco to bring back talks on a $10 billion refining and petrochemicals complex in China, Bloomberg reported citing unnamed sources. The Saudi oil giant is holding initial talks with partners including the state-owned defense contractor Norinco on the facility in the Northeastern province of Liaoning. This happens as the oil market is witnessing recovery from the pandemic repercussions, with crude approaching $100 a barrel up from less than $40 a barrel during the first pandemic lockdown.
