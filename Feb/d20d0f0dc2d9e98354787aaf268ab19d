DUBAI: The UAE extended on Monday a decision to ground all private drones and light sports aircraft used for recreational purposes until further notice, Emirates News Agency said. The original decision was announced in January, following a deadly drone attack on the UAE by the Houthi militia. Entities and companies that have work contracts or commercial projects that depend on the use of drones must communicate with the General Authority for Civil Aviation to obtain the necessary exceptions and permits to carry out their work and projects during this period, WAM reported. Anyone found to be breaking the ban will be subject to a jail sentence of between six months and five years and a fine of at least AED100,000 ($27,226), or one of these punishments.
