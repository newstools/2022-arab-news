RIYADH: Meta, previously called Facebook, has announced a ‘Boost with Facebook’ program in partnership with a UAE Ministry of Economy project, The Entrepreneurial Nation. The initiative aims to support startups through three stages: a skill-up academy, a scale-up program, and a startup track. Meta aims to play a significant role in supporting the digitisation of businesses in the UAE. The Boost with Facebook program has already started a virtual workshop recently by offering training on social commerce activities on Meta platforms. The UAE is aiming to become home to 20 startups valued at more than $1 billion by 2031.
