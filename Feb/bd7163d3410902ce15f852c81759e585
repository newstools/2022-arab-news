RIYADH: The winter season has pushed gas supply shortages to the brink in many regions including Oklahoma, Turkey, and Iraq. Elsewhere, bold initiatives like those in Cape Town and India signal a green future ahead. Looking at the bigger picture: ·Cape Town, South Africa is set to procure as much as 200 megawatts from independent producers in the country within the upcoming two weeks, Bloomberg reported. This comes as part of a bigger plan that aims to secure a total of 700 megawatts of power for the city to curb potential outages. ·India plans to add grants worth 195 billion rupees ($2.6 billion) to ramp up solar equipment production domestically, Bloomberg reported. This is mainly attributed to the fact that the South Asian country intends to be less dependent on China for solar power equipment. ·Natural gas supplies in the US state of Oklahoma dropped 22 percent amid severely cold weather conditions, according to Bloomberg. ·Turkey and Iraq are forced to search for alternative gas suppliers as Iran cuts flows amid cold weather conditions, Bloomberg reported. While Turkey is considering turning to the spot market to procure liquefied natural gas supplies to curb shortfalls, Iraq is seeking supplies from neighbor Qatar. Through a micro lens: ·Danish investment firm, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners had announced its collaboration with Spanish corporations Naturgy, Engas, and Fertiberia as it plans a green hydrogen and ammonia project in Spain, CNBC reported. Referred to as “Project Catalina”, the project aims to generate 5GW of solar and wind power and produce green hydrogen via a 2GW electrolyzer as well.
