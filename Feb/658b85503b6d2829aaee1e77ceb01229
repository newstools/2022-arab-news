MANAMA: Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett arrived in Bahrain’s capital Manama on Monday in the highest-level visit since the countries established relations under a 2020 US-sponsored deal.
Bennett will meet with Bahraini Crown Prince and Prime Minister Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa, his office said.
“The leaders will discuss additional ways to strengthen bilateral ties ... especially the advancement of diplomatic and economic issues, with an emphasis on technology and innovation,” it said in a statement. The prime minister, who is also set to see other top officials and members of the Jewish community, said he will hold “a series of meetings whose goal is to fill - with energy and content - the peace agreement between the two nations.”
“In these tumultuous times it's important that from this region we send a message of good-will, of cooperation of standing together against common challenges,” he added.
The trip follows a visit to Manama by Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz earlier this month that saw the two countries sign a defence agreement.
That deal covered intelligence, procurement and joint training, with Gantz boasting that it further solidified the nascent diplomatic relationship.
