RIYADH: Abdullah Al-Rabiah, the general supervisor of the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSrelief), met Hassan and Mahmoud, formerly conjoined twins from Egypt, in Riyadh on Wednesday, 13 years after they were successfully separated during an operation in the city. Surgeons at King Abdulaziz Medical City operated on the twins in 2009 when they were just 9 months old. They were joined at the abdomen and shared a number of organs and body parts, including intestine, bowel and urinary tract. Al-Rabiah said that the Kingdom will remain a beacon for needy and disaffected people all around the world. The medical program under which Hassan and Mahmoud were separated is an extension of the country’s great humanitarian work, he added, which is carried out under the directives of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The twins were accompanied on their visit to the capital by their parents, who thank the people and the government of Saudi Arabia for organizing the surgery and treatment of their sons by a specialized medical team. The boys’ health has improved steadily over the years, they added.
