DUBAI: The Dubai property market is set to benefit when Expo 2020 transitions into a mixed-used community, Zoom Property said. Called “District 2020,” the new community will reuse and retain at least 80 percent of the infrastructure used for the World Expo, which the portal expects will generate high levels of interest from buyers and investors. “This move is not only going to impact the real estate industry but the overall economy, since it will give a boost to the commercial activities in the areas closer to the Expo site,” Ata Shobeiry, CEO at Zoom Property, said. The emirate’s real estate industry has already seen the impact of expo, the portal said, particularly for short-term rentals in neighborhoods near the venue.
