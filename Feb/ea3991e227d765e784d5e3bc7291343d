The Saudi Arabian women’s national football team have beaten the Maldives 2-0 in only their second international match, which took place at the National Stadium in Male. The female Falcons made history on Sunday when they defeated the Seychelles 2-0 in their debut match at the mini-tournament in the Maldives. Once again, it was Al-Bandari Mubarak — scorer of the opening goal against the Seychelles — who took center stage, breaking the deadlock against the host nation in the 62nd minute, before doubling the lead eight minutes from the final whistle. For the second match running, the Saudi defence held out for a clean sheet for a final score of 2-0. The win over the Seychelles brought international acclaim for the team and German coach Monika Staab, with Brazilian football legend Pele leading the congratulations. “Today is a historic day, not only for you, but for everyone who loves football,” he tweeted. “I want to congratulate the @SaudiFF (Saudi Arabian Football Federation) and their women’s National Football Team for their first ever official FIFA match.”
