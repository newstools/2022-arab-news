LONDON: Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday welcomed collaboration to advance a durable resolution that ends the conflict in Yemen and creates the space for Yemenis to collectively determine their own future. 
Blinken made the comments during a phone call with UN Special Envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg, the State Department said.
Blinken renewed his support for Grundberg’s “ongoing efforts to develop an inclusive political framework and reiterated that justice and accountability will be key to securing an enduring peace in Yemen.”
He reiterated that ending the war in Yemen remains a top US foreign policy priority, and called for the urgent need for de-escalation.
“The secretary expressed deep concern with the uptick in civilian casualties in Yemen as well as the region and condemned attacks by all parties that lead to escalation in Yemen and extend the conflict,” the State Department said.
