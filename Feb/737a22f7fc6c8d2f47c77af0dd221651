RIYADH: Turkey has lifted the ban on importing scrap metal from Lebanon, which will secure $100 million of “fresh dollars” annually for the country. Since 2018, the ban has been depriving the Lebanese economy of nearly $100 million in export revenues annually, Lebanon’s National News Agency reported citing the economy and trade minister. Prior to the embargo, Lebanon exported to Turkey over 40 percent of the total exported scrap metal, Amin Salam said. He added the decision came during a visit to Turkey by a delegation headed by the Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati last week.
