TOKYO: The International Judo Federation (IJF) decided on Sunday in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine to suspend the status of IJF Honorary Chairman and Goodwill Ambassadorship previously granted to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin has been involved in judo since childhood and is recognized as an eight-dan, a very high-ranking practitioner. He has also written a book on Judo, and on a trip to Japan he visited the headquarters of Judo at the Kodokan (Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo). In addition, according to a TBS report, he has maintained a close relationship with IJF Chairman Marius Vizer and with Yasuhiro Yamashita, Chairman of both the All Japan Judo Federation and the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC). On Friday, the IJF announced the cancellation of the Grand Slam, a tournament scheduled for May in Kazan, Central Russia, but did not directly mention Russia at that time, stating: “We are deeply saddened by the international situation, one that has resulted through insufficient dialogue between countries.”
