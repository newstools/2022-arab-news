WASHINGTON: The United States on Wednesday announced sanctions against what it said were members of an international financing network for Yemen’s Houthi militia after the Iran-backed group recently escalated cross-border drone and missile attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE. 
The sanctions are aimed at a source of the militia’s financial support, targeting shipping companies and other businesses that the US says smuggles petroleum and other commodities around the Middle East, Asia and Africa to fund the Houthis.
President Joe Biden said last month that the United States was considering redesignating the Houthis and Houthi leaders as terrorists, a step that typically carries harsh US government penalties for those doing business with them.
The Trump administration imposed that designation in its last days. The Biden administration lifted it as one of its first acts as aid groups said the penalties would scare away commercial food suppliers and humanitarian efforts in an already chronically hungry country.
