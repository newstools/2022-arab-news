JEDDAH: The government has designated 2022 as the “Year of Saudi Coffee” and is seeking ideas from the public on how to mark the occasion. Coffee has long been an intrinsic part of Saudi culture, representing values such as generosity and hospitality, and regularly features in songs, poems and paintings. Now, the Ministry of Culture has decided to recognize that relationship with a yearlong celebration of the ubiquitous bean as a cultural and national symbol. Prince Badr Al-Saud, the minister of culture and governor of the Royal Commission for AlUla, took to Twitter to whip up support for the idea across the Kingdom. “We are awaiting your creative ideas in the #2022YearofSaudiCoffee initiative,” he said. “Your distinctive ideas will be implemented with the support of the initiative.” According to the ministry’s website, the goals of the initiative are to celebrate coffee as a cultural product of Saudi Arabia and accentuate the connection between coffee and the national identity. It will also showcase the Kingdom’s Khawlani coffee beans, highlighting the traditional ways of growing and preparing them, and the many ways the drink can be enjoyed.
