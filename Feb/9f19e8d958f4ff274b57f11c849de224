DUBAI: The UAE will gradually lift various COVID-related restrictions from Tuesday as the number of infections and hospitalization rate continues to fall. Cinemas will operate at maximum capacity from Tuesday, state-run news agency WAM  quoted the Media Regulatory Office as saying. The decision was issued by the National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Authority “stipulates that each emirate can modify cinema capacity, easing or tightening procedures as they deem fit.” Local press reported that maximum capacity will also be allowed for social events such as weddings and funerals. However, the authority announced that each Emirate would decide locally the appropriate percentage for holding different social events. The same rules will apply for places of worship, with social distancing in mosques, churches and other worship places to be reduced to one meter, while the situation continues to be monitored closely by the authority. Preventive measures such as the mandatory wearing of masks, social distancing and constant sanitization, would stay in place. In January, the UAE witnessed a hike in coronavirus cases and has recorded on some days up to 3,000 infections per day. But the daily cases have been on the decline recently, prompting the government to announce last week that it will ease virus-related restrictions. On Sunday, Feb. 13, the UAE reported 1,266 new cases of coronavirus and 2,513 recoveries.
