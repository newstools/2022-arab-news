DUBAI: Model, singer and actress Sonia Ammar turned 23 over the weekend, and for the occasion decided to pay sartorial homage to the 1960s star Jane Birkin. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle She celebrated her birthday in Los Angeles with the close friends, including her partner Rocco Basilico, Moroccan model Rania Benchegra, Swedish supermodel Elsa Hosk and Australian-Palestinian photographer Sarah Bahbah. The French-Tunisian birthday girl wore a near-exact replica of the white, crochet dress that Birkin wore backwards with a brooch clipped at the navel at The Artists Union Gala in Paris in 1969 with French singer Serge Gainsbourg, making us do a double take. The “Scream” actress opted to let the dress do all the talking, pairing her ensemble with a delicate gold necklace and a stack of gold bracelets, whereas Birkin stayed true to her laissez-faire style by wearing her dress with a set of off-beat, bohemian rings.   Paris-born Ammar has previously cited the young Jane Birkin as her ultimate beauty icon. Today, at 75 years old, Birkin remains one of the most acclaimed muses in the fashion world. Ammar, who is also of Polish descent, has plenty in common with the British-born fashion icon, who was also a model, singer and actress in her youth. However, Birkin wasn’t the only celebrity that the star sartorially evoked on her birthday. In addition to the white, plunging crochet design, Ammar also wore a slinky, metallic dress that was close to the spirit of US socialite Paris Hilton’s 21st birthday look in 2002. The chain-mail style dress has seen a bit of a resurgence with the millennial model squad, including Kendall Jenner, who donned a glittering, $9,000 LaBourjoisie minidress for her 21st birthday in 2016. Ammar styled her plunging gown with matching silver jewelry, including a cuff and necklace. She completed the look with a pair of Lucite heels.
