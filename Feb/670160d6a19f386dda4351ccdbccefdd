DUBAI: Abu Dhabi has approved regulations for the implementation of the Civil Marriage and Divorce Law, which covers family matters for expats or foreigners, state news agency WAM reported. The regulations cover civil marriage and its effects, including civil divorce, joint custody of children, financial rights arising out of divorce, wills, civil inheritance, and adoption. Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Presidential Affairs and Chairman of Abu Dhabi Judicial Department (ADJD), on Sunday issued decision No. 8 of 2022 approving the regulations for the implementation of the Civil Marriage and Divorce Law No. 14 of 2020 in Abu Dhabi. In the new law, civil marriages will be implemented based on the will of both the husband and wife. The woman will not be required to get consent from her family when she decides to get married. Spouses will also no longer need to prove harm was done in the marriage and divorce can take place by either of the spouses. “According to the law, divorce among expat couples can now be granted at the first hearing without the need to go to the family guidance department and couples separating will no longer be required to go through mandatory reconciliation sessions,” a report by Khaleej Times said. The wife’s financial rights will further be based on several criteria, such as the number of years of marriage, the age of the wife, the economic standing of each of the spouses and more. Custody of children, according to the new law will be equally shared between the parents.
