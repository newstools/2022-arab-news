RIYADH: The revival of a nuclear deal with Iran should be a starting point for addressing issues in the region, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister told Al Arabiya on Monday. Prince Faisal bin Farhan said there would be no stability in the region without addressing the causes of concerns and that restoring the nuclear agreement with Iran alone was not enough. The foreign minister is in Brussels for a Gulf-EU meeting and met with the high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy on Sunday. During his meeting with Josep Borrell, the two officials exchanged views on Iran’s nuclear program and joint efforts to stop Houthi violations in Yemen that are obstructing a political solution in the country. Prince Faisal also told Al Arabiya that he had offered the EU the chance to contribute to renaissance plans in the region and requested the European bloc to exempt Gulf Cooperation Council nationals from entry visas. He added that he hoped the Russia-Ukraine crisis would be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy.
