RIYADH: The Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen said it carried out airstrikes in Yemen’s capital, Al Ekhbariya reported on Friday.
The airstrikes were in response to threats and were necessary to protect civilians, the coalition said.
The Iran-backed Houthi militia regularly target Saudi Arabia, mainly using drones and missiles against civilian infrastructure.
Last week, a drone attack on Abha International Airport in the Kingdom’s south left twelve civilians injured.
On Jan. 17, three civilians died after the militia used drones to attack the UAE.
The Houthi militia seized the capital from the Yemeni government in 2014 and continue to control large parts of the country.
The government, with the support of regional allies, has been attempting to prevent the military expansion of the militia, who enjoy support from Iran and other terror-designated entities.
Diplomatic efforts to resolve the seven-year conflict have so far been unsuccessful.
