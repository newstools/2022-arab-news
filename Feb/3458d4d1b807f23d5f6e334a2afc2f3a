DUBAI: Emirati entrepreneur and jewelry designer Salama Khalfan has been named Marie Claire Arabia’s editor-at-large. She will contribute to the magazine’s beauty, social, fashion and celebrity sections, as well as working on photo shoots and events. Khalfan will work closely with Obeida Danhach, CEO and chief content officer of the magazine’s parent company Mediaquest, and Farah Kreidieh, editor-in-chief of Marie Claire Arabia. “Like her astonishing creations, Salama’s journey has been impressive and inspirational. Her perspective on trends, be they societal, fashion or creative, will enhance our content and differentiate us further,” Danhach said. Born, raised and educated in the UAE, Khalfan is a finance graduate and MBA holder. She spent just over a decade at Mubadala, focusing on the aerospace and technology sectors, before starting her fashion and design career in 2014. Khalfan moved into the fashion industry with her homegrown brand Lovetown and became a serial investor in the technology, healthcare and hospitality sectors. In November 2018, she opened her first flagship store, Salama Fine Jewellery, in Dubai. “Marie Claire is a beacon in women’s media, both in France and the UAE. Its clear and unique positioning is strongly aligned with my own approach to content that makes a difference. I believe this collaboration is a natural fit,” Khalfan said.
