CAIRO: A UN human rights expert was in Sudan on Monday to verify allegations of human rights violations after an October military coup plunged the country into turmoil and triggered nearly daily street protests. Adama Dieng, the UN’s expert on human rights in Sudan, arrived in the capital of Khartoum on Sunday, a month after Sudan’s authorities asked for the postponement of his visit, according to the UN Human Rights Council. Dieng was a UN special adviser on the prevention of genocide and served as an investigator for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. He was appointed in November to monitor the human rights situation in Sudan after the Oct. 25 military coup. Dieng met Monday with acting Justice Minister Mohamed Saeed Al-Hilu. He will also meet with other government officials, activists and civil society groups. Dieng’s mission is to verify allegations of human rights abuses during protests that have been taking place since the takeover, said Gomaa Al-Wakil, head of the human rights department at the Justice Ministry. The takeover has upended Sudan’s transition to democratic rule after three decades of repression and international isolation under former President Omar Bashir. The African nation has been on a fragile path to democracy since a popular uprising forced the military to remove Bashir and his government in April 2019. Sudan has been politically paralyzed since the coup, with near-daily street protests. Authorities launched a major crackdown on protesters. Sudanese security forces have also been accused of using sexual violence against women taking part in the demonstrations. The UN called for an investigation. Hundreds of activists and protest leaders were also detained complicating UN-led international efforts to find a way out of the stalemate.
