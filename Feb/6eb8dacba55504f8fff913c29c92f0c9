JEDDAH: The Council of Ministers has chosen Feb. 22 to commemorate the Founding Day of Saudi Arabia. Annual celebrations will recognize the foundation of the first Saudi state in 1727 by Imam Mohammed bin Saud, a move that brought unity, peace, and stability to the Arabian Peninsula following centuries of fragmentation and dissension. Cabinet members intend the day to be marked with pride and to focus on the history of the country and its leaders. During the council meeting, ministers also discussed ways to further strengthen international relations and channels of communication and lauded the restoration of diplomatic ties between the Kingdom and Thailand in the wake of Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha’s recent visit to Riyadh for talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Minister of Media Dr. Majid bin Abdullah Al-Qasabi, told the Saudi Press Agency that the Cabinet had reviewed the outcome of a recent meeting of Arab foreign ministers, held in Kuwait, aimed at improving cooperation on regional development, peace, prosperity, and security issues. In addition, council members discussed January’s meeting of senior representatives of the governments of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the UAE, the UK, and the US during which repeated attacks by the Iran-backed Houthis against civilians in Yemen, the Kingdom, and the UAE, were condemned. The five nations called for a comprehensive political solution in Yemen and reaffirmed their support for the UN special envoy to the war-torn country. Other matters included a call for Saudi government talks with Slovenia on amending a general agreement for cooperation between the two countries, and negotiations with Singapore over drafting a memorandum of understanding to promote the digital economy, emerging technologies, and digital governance. Ministers also requested that a MoU be drawn up with South Africa on mineral resources.
