RIYADH: Saudi Arabia, represented by the Saudi Space Commission, took part in a recent steering committee meeting for the joint international declaration of the Global Observing System for Climate during which future projects, goals and aspirations were discussed. The participants reviewed the declaration, along with opportunities to organize awareness assistance activities at the international, regional and local levels to enhance and build joint capabilities to achieve its goals. The participation of the commission in the meeting follows on from the Kingdom joining the international declaration for the Space Climate Observatory, which aims to adopt solutions based on space technologies to help limit the climate challenges the world is facing. Saudi authorities said the Kingdom’s participation in these meetings stems from its role in global efforts to limit the effects of climate change through its commitments to international standards and agreements.
