DUBAI: Hussein Dajani is leaving Nissan Motor Co. for a partner role at Deloitte Digital Middle East. He will join the company in the Middle East region as a partner in advertising, marketing and commerce from April. Dajani, who joined Nissan in 2017, is currently general manager for digital and customer experience transformation for Africa, Middle East, India, Turkey and Oceania. Before joining Nissan, Dajani gained extensive experience over a two-decade-long career both on the agency and client side at companies such as Red Bull and Virgin Mobile, and agencies groups such as WPP and Publicis, where he oversaw local and multinational clients, including STC, Nestle and HSBC. “Deloitte is an organization I have been eagerly looking forward to being part of for many years,” Dajani told Arab News. “They define a new model that blends the strengths of agencies with traditional consultancies, by combining the creative and digital capabilities of their studios, and the broad reach of an advertising agency, with the technical experience, deep business strategy and relationships of the world’s largest consultancy to create something that is so much more than the sum of its parts,” he added. Dajani also sits on the advisory board of the CMO Council Middle East, the CXPA Middle East Regional Leadership Council, and is an advisory director with the Customer Institute.
