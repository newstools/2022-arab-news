RIYADH: The General Presidency for the Affairs of the Two Holy Mosques is handing out 25,000 gifts to Hajj pilgrims who have completed their pilgrimage and are heading home. The gifts include roses, jasmine, prayer rugs, incense, sweets, and souvenirs and the head of the presidency Sheikh Abdulrahman Al-Sudais participated in distributing the gifts. Most pilgrims completed their Hajj on Monday after performing the symbolic “stoning of the devil” ritual in Mina and then carrying out the final ritual of Tawaf Al-Wida’ at the Grand Mosque in Makkah.
