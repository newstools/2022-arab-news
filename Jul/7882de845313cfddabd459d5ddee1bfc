RIYADH: US special envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking is traveling to the capitals of Saudi Arabia and Jordan to continue diplomatic efforts in support of the truce in Yemen. The trip, starting on Monday, follows US President Joe Biden’s recent visit to Jeddah during which Yemen figured prominently in discussions, the US State Department said in a statement. “In close coordination with the UN special envoy and our regional and Yemeni partners, special envoy Lenderking will continue our efforts to help advance peace,” the statement said. The envoy’s engagements will focus on “expanding, extending, and renewing the current truce agreement that will further the tangible benefits already reaching Yemenis and build towards a more comprehensive, inclusive peace process and permanent ceasefire.” The truce in Yemen first came into effect in April and was then extended for a two-month period in June. It ends on August 2 and the international community is keen for it to be extended. The US called on “all parties to choose peace and recovery over continued war and destruction for the sake of the Yemeni people.”
