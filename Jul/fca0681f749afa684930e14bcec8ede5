LONDON: Google revealed on Tuesday that YouTube will roll out the picture-in-picture feature for iPhones and iPads, which allows users to watch videos in a floating window while using other apps. “We recognise this has been a slow roll out for a highly requested feature, and want to thank everyone who shared feedback during experiments and wait,” Google announced in a blog post. While the feature has been a long time coming, not all YouTube users will be able to benefit from this rollout. Users in the US will have access to this feature for non-music content on the YouTube app for iPhones and iPads. Meanwhile, the company announced that it will give access to picture-in-picture for both music and non-music content to all premium members worldwide. For Apple devices, the feature will be available on devices running on iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. This rollout comes amid various other policies that YouTube has announced will be applied in the coming weeks. Starting July 29, YouTube channels will no longer be able to hide their subscriber counts, a move often used by spammers to conceal their activity online. YouTube is also limiting the type and frequency of special characters that can be used in channel names, another common spammer tactic. And finally, YouTube announced that its “increase strictness” comment moderation setting will be rolling out to all creators. The option is aimed at filtering out comments more aggressively than the default setting, potentially eliminating more spam content.
