GENEVA: Saudi Arabia is participating in World Intellectual Property Organization meetings in Geneva, which started on July 14 and run until July 22. Leading the delegation is the CEO of the Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property, Dr. Abdulaziz Al-Suwailem. Al-Suwailem gave a speech providing insights into the development of intellectual property in the Kingdom as it had joined the Nairobi Treaty, bringing the number of WIPO treaties it has joined to 12, the Saudi Press Agency reported. He said the SAIP had implemented training and qualification programs for judges specializing in intellectual property cases and allocating material on the basics of intellectual property in the Kingdom. A guide to intellectual property policies has been launched in universities and research centers. Al-Suwailem said the SAIP had celebrated this year's World Intellectual Property Day under the slogan of “Your Ideas, Our Future” with awareness campaigns and events across the country. The SAIP recently celebrated granting its 10,000th patent, coinciding with an increase in the number of filings by up to 30 percent and an increase in patent examiners at the authority.
