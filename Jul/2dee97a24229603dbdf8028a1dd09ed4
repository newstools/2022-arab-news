RIYADH: The Saudi Ministry of Culture recently concluded the Industrial Heritage Program, a specialized training workshop included in the ministry’s Experts Program. Industrial heritage covers ancient Saudi industrial culture, including technological, social, architectural and scientific information. It covers buildings, machines, factories, mines, refineries and warehouses. Sixteen participants from Saudi Arabia came together for the two-week course to broaden their understanding of industrial heritage. They learned about mechanisms and frameworks related to the cataloging of industrial heritage. The workshop hosted several international experts, including Moulshri Joshi, Julian Sobrino Simal, Ona Vileikis Tamayo, Kai Weise, Rusudan Mirzikashvili, Mizuko Ugo, Massimo Preite, Mirhan Damir and Adnan Al-Jaber. The training is part of a series of specialized workshops organized by the ministry, in cooperation with the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property, under the umbrella of the Experts Program. The capacity-building sessions qualify specialists in UNESCO Conventions and Programs with the aim of boosting expertise in the international cultural arena as well as enhancing skills in UNESCO methodologies. The Experts Program targets Saudi specialists and people across various disciplines interested in preserving the Kingdom’s heritage. The program provides training workshops to familiarize Saudis with international cultural protection protocols, such as The World Heritage Convention, The Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage and The Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage, among others.
