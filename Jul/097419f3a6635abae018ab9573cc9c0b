ARAFAT: About a million worshippers have begun moving back to Mina through Muzdalifah in preparation for the final stages of their Hajj after earlier converging to witness the Arafat sermon, the most important ritual.  A few minutes after sunset, the pilgrims began moving to the open but rocky plains of Muzdalifah, where they will pray the Maghrib and Isha and collect pebbles for the stoning of the devil ritual at Jamrat Al-Aqabah on Saturday, which is the first day of Eid Al-Adha and the 10th day of Dhul Hijjah. The following three days — Sunday, Monday and Tuesday — are the days of Tashreeq, on which the pilgrims will throw seven stones on each of the small, medium and big Jamarat. Ambulances are accompanying the bus caravans on their way to Muzdalifah, while security patrols are enforcing intervals between the vehicles to ensure a smooth traffic flow. Some pilgrims are traveling on foot via the 25-km walkway that connects Arafat with Mina through Muzdalifah, and is the longest of its kind in the world.
