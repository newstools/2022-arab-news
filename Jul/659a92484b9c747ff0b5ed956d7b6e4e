Saudi Arabian runner Yasmine Al-Dabbagh has been eliminated from the 2022 World Athletics Championships after finishing seventh in Heat 3 of the women’s 100-meter sprint competition in Oregon on Saturday. Al-Dabbagh, who took part in the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, managed a time of 13.21 seconds, well behind Heat winner Eliane Thompson-Herah of Jamaica (11.15), second place Nzubechi Grace Nwokocha (11.16) of Nigeria and third place Zaynab Dosso of Italy (11.26). The competition, which will run until July 24, will see the participation of Saudi pole vaulter Hussain Al-Hizam. Runner Mazen Al-Yassin had to pull out before the start of the tournament due to a last-minute injury. The 2022 World Athletics Championships was 24-year-old Al-Dabbagh’s second international contest, having previously represented the Kingdom at the delayed Tokyo Olympics last summer, also in the 100 meters. Al-Hizam, 24, will make his international debut next Friday when he competes in a field of 32.
