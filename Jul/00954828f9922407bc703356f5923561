Japan is allocating a $3.5M emergency grant to Lebanon through the World Food Program (WFP), as food security around the world is being threatened, especially with the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The assistance will enable WFP to provide monthly in-kind food parcels for 300,000 Lebanese to help them meet their nutritional requirements during these critical times. Through this initiative, Japan is renewing its commitment to continue its support to the Lebanese people, and to contribute to the alleviation of the repercussions of the socio-economic crisis on the country.
