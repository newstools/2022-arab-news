RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s annual consumer inflation rate surged to 2.3 percent in June, from 2.2 percent in May, according to the latest data released by the General Authority for Statistics. The slight uptick in the inflation rate was primarily driven by a rise in food and beverage prices, which increased by 4.4 percent. “Food and beverages prices were the main drivers of the inflation rate in June 2022 due to their high relative importance in the Saudi consumer basket with a weight of 18.8 percent,” said GASTAT.
