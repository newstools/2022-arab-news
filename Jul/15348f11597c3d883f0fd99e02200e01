RIYADH: Saudi deputy minister for protocol affairs, Khalid bin Faisal Al-Sehli, on Wednesday received the Ivory Coast’s envoy to Saudi Arabia, Coulibaly Drissa. During their meeting in Riyadh — that followed Al-Sehli’s recent talks with the Turkish ambassador to the Kingdom, Fatih Ulusoy — they discussed diplomatic relations between the two countries and issues of mutual interest. Earlier, on behalf of the Saudi foreign affairs minister, ambassador Al-Sehli hosted a farewell lunch in honor of Belgium’s envoy to Riyadh, Dominique Mineur. In June, the deputy minister met with Azerbaijan’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Shahin Abdullayev.
