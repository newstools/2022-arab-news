DUBAI: The Dubai-based Indian artist discusses a work from his minimalist ‘Man in a Box’ series. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle As the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded, I understood the world would change completely. This became even more evident when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder soon after. That’s when I started dissecting my inner world through sketches and illustrations. I call this series “Man in a Box,” as it depicts complex human emotions and issues in very simple forms in squares. As an architect, I have always looked at life through lines and squares, and these sketches follow the same philosophy. I have a minimalistic approach to art as well. I believe there are simple solutions to complex problems.   In “Perceptions of Skin,” I wanted to show how the world is distinctly divided into black and white; the way we perceive the world in these two shades when it comes to matters of both race and belief. We live in a world where realities and perceptions blur often. Since mankind has claimed dominance over the planet, without doubt, our future is on uncertain ground. This artwork comprises three squares. On either side are two sets of semicircles, depicting the eyes, and in the middle square is a machine with a single eye. Black, for me, represents the dark and gloomy aspects of life. White portrays simplicity. Yellow is for hope and happiness, and red stands for intensity. The sketch also symbolizes how, in the world we are living in, there is a complete disconnect between yin and yang. So there's no harmony. The actual sketch took only a day or two. The conceptualization takes longer. At first, my artworks might look quite simple, but I believe the plot is what will pull you in. Art has to engage and convey a message; it has the power to change minds and societies. Through “Man in a Box,” I am trying to do my bit and I hope that my audience will see my perspective. All my inner turmoil is now out in these sketches.
