CAIRO: Egypt will continue to seek resolutions to conflicts worldwide, including finding a permanent solution to the plight of the Palestinian people, the country’s ambassador said at the 10th World Peace Forum in Beijing. The forum’s theme this year, held from July 2 to 5, is titled “Preserving International Stability: Commonality, Comprehensiveness and Cooperation.” Speaking at the gathering organized by Tsinghua University, Mohamed El-Badri said that Cairo’s foreign policy is based on recognizing the sovereignty of other nations. El-Badri also highlighted the importance of ensuring that the world’s nations tackle terrorism, promote inclusive religious discourse, and deal with various crises in the Middle East. The Chinese government was playing a leading role in resolving the issue of Palestine, which would help to bring peace and stability to the region, he said. El-Badri said Egypt’s relations with China had developed into a strategic partnership since 2014, thanks to the guidance of the two nations’ political leaders. There was widespread trade and investment cooperation with Beijing, including the joint manufacture of coronavirus vaccines, and various other projects including the construction of the financial and business district in the new administrative capital, said El-Badri.
