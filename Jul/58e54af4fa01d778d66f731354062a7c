The 34-year-old South African won $4 million. Grace beat Mexico’s Carlos Ortiz by two strokes. “Played flawless golf, played really, really well when I needed to do something special and came up and managed to pull it out,” Grace said. “But just what a great day, it was amazing to come here, this new format, this new everything is amazing and everybody here is having a blast.” Ortiz, ranked No. 119 in the world, shot a 69. Johnson (71) finished four back with Patrick Reed (67). The 48-man field in Oregon competed for a $20 million purse, with an additional $5 million prize fund for a team competition. There was no cut and even the last-place finisher earned a payday of $120,000. Charl Schwartzel won the tour’s inaugural event outside of London (and the team portion) and pocketed $4.75 million. The Four Aces team, led by Johnson, won the team competition at Pumpkin Ridge. LIV Golf also announced Saturday that English player Pat Casey has joined the series.
