RIYADH: International investors have a “unique opportunity” to tap into Saudi Arabia’s growing private education sector, according to a partner at L.E.K. Consulting’s Global Education Practice. The comments came following a report by the firm that revealed the Kingdom’s private K-12 education sector — the time from kindergarten to 12th grade — showed resilience to the impact of COVID-19 by growing at a compound annual rate of one percent over the past six years. The international segment of the private education sector was particularly strong, seeing a growth of 8 percent from assessment years 2015-20. Reflecting on the report’s findings, L.E.K.’s Chinmay Jhaveri said: “The private K-12 education market in Saudi Arabia is highly fragmented, with top global K-12 school chains accounting for less than 20 percent of the overall private education sector enrolment. “A number of prominent global K-12 school chains are yet to establish a presence in Saudi Arabia. “The Kingdom’s largely local demand for K-12 education presents an opportunity for international operators as it ensures a steady student base. “This also presents a unique opportunity for investors looking to gain long-term value in Saudi Arabia’s K-12 education sector.” L.E.K. Consulting’s report noted that the population enrolled in private K-12 schools constitute 15 percent of the overall 5.9 million market in Saudi Arabia.
