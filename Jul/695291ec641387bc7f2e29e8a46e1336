They maintained their dominance in the second half to lead 59-43 at the end of the third quarter. Despite some spirited play by the Saudis in the closing stages of the match to close the gap on their opponents, Jordan still ran out winner by 10 points. Top scorer for the Falcons was Khalid Abdel-Gabar with 19 points, followed by Muthanna Al-Marwani, who managed 14. Saudi Arabia on Thursday night lost their second match at the 2022 FIBA Asia Cup, going down 76-52 to defending champions Australia, having also lost their opening Group A match 80-54 to Indonesia on Tuesday.
