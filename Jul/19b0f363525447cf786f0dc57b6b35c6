LONDON: Manga Productions, the leading producer of the creative content industry in the Arab region, announced on Monday it will move its headquarters to Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Nonprofit City, which will open in 2024. The relocation will “ignite a new media sector within the city,” a statement revealed. It will also support the city’s aim to foster a new generation of creative Saudi talents. “At Manga Productions, we aim to inspire the heroes of tomorrow. Our new headquarters in Prince Mohammed bin Salman Nonprofit City will allow us to cultivate a culture of youth and creativity, create opportunity and inspire minds of the creative industry, while fostering young Saudi talent,” Dr. Essam Bukhary, CEO of Manga Productions, said. Manga Productions, a subsidiary of the Mohammed bin Salman Foundation, or Misk, has recently increased its efforts to foster the creative arts in Saudi Arabia and beyond. Recently, the company announced the launch of “AlUla Adventures,” a one-of-a-kind experience to visit the Kingdom without physically traveling, essentially transporting or “teleporting” a person to AlUla. “Manga Productions’ new base will form part of the city’s human-centered ecosystem, which puts Saudi youth at its core,” David Henry, CEO of Prince Mohammed bin Salman Nonprofit City, said. “It will support the goals of the city and Vision 2030 to provide skills and opportunities for young Saudi talents, inspire them to realize their creative ambitions, while attracting global talent.” Mohammed bin Salman Nonprofit City, which was announced last March, aims to serve as a model for the development of the nonprofit sector globally. Located in Irqah neighborhood, Prince Mohammed bin Salman Nonprofit City is adjacent to Wadi Hanifa and spreads over an area of more than 3.4 square kilometers. The city will house venture capital companies and investors who will support and incubate talent and businesses to drive community contributions from around the world.
