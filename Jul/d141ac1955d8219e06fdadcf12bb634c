The Sayed Al-Shuhada Mosque is an important site in Islamic history as it tells the story of the Battle of Uhud, which took place during the third Hijri year. It is also located next to the cemetery of 70 martyrs of Prophet Muhammad’s companions, about three kilometers away from the northern square of the Prophet’s Mosque. The mosque was completed in April of 2017 and features a unique architectural style. It covers an area of 54,000 square meters and can accommodate up to 15,000 worshippers. Supporting services and facilities can be found outside the site. The mosque faces Mount Rumat, a small hill located to the west of Mount Uhud. The Uhud Martyr’s Square, along with the landmarks it contains, can be seen from the top of the hill. Historical sources say that the army of the Quraysh tribe and its allies went to Madinah to kill Muslims and avenge those who died in the Battle of Badr, which took place in the second Hijri year. Muslims confronted them, with the Prophet Muhammad deploying archers on Mount Rumat. He ordered the archers to stay in their posts unless told to move. When the attackers began to flee, the archers thought the battle was over and that they had won. They came down the mountain, disregarding the Prophet Muhammad’s order. The commander of the attackers, Khalid bin Al-Walid, who had not yet converted to Islam, surprised the descending archers, killed them, then attacked the other Muslims. Seventy of the Prophet’s companions were killed, including his uncle Hamzah bin Abdul-Muttalib. They were buried at the battle site at the base of Mount Rumat. Muslims visit their graves to this day, as the Prophet Muhammad once did. Worshippers also ascend the mountain to observe the site of the battle.
