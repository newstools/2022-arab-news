New Al-Ittihad coach Nuno Espirito Santo has informed the club’s management of his list of requests, which includes signing a new foreign midfielder to replace Brazilian Bruno Henrique, Arabic language daily Arriyadiyah reported. Also on his wishlist is being informed of all internal decisions regarding existing players, loaning out a number of the club’s promising youngsters before the end of the summer transfer window and signing a right winger. Santo, who signed his contract at the Jeddah club at the end of last week after the dismissal of Cosmin Contra, urged the administration, headed by President Anmar Al-Haili, to find the right replacement for Henrique, who reportedly failed to convince the former Tottenham and Wolverhampton coach. Santo also warned that all players must arrive early for pre-season training, which begins July 20. He refused any delays to the schedule, except for players who could provide a convincing reason to the technical staff. Al-Ittihad’s squad on July 23 will leave for Austria to take part in a training camp, which will run for three weeks and include three friendly matches against Fiorentina of Italy, Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg and the UAE’s Al-Wahda.
