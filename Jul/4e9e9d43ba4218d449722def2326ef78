DOHA: A fine of up to QR250,000 (around $69,000) will be imposed on anyone who issues, sells, resells, or exchanges World Cup tickets without FIFA permission, Qatar’s Ministry of Justice has tweeted. The penalty comes under Law No. (10) 2021 regarding Qatar’s measures to host the World Cup 2022 in November. FIFA has reiterated the ban on ticket transfers on its website: “Tickets that have been impermissibly transferred are not valid and may be cancelled at any time without notice.” The reasons for the restrictions include match security, consumer protection, avoidance of counterfeit tickets, and protection of a fair pricing scheme. FIFA said if someone could not attend a match, they could put their tickets up for resale on its official resale platform.
