Morocco have reached the semifinals of the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations for the first time after beating Botswana 2-1 on Wednesday at Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat. The win means that the Atlas Lionesses have confirmed their maiden qualification for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup set to take place in Australia and New Zealand. It is the first time that a team from North Africa has managed this achievement.

Sanaa Mssoudy gave the home team an early lead at three minutes but Botswana equalized through Keitumetse Dithebe only four minutes later, and the teams went in at halftime all square. Fatima Tagnaout, already with an assist to her name, set up Yasmin Mrabet’s winner on 59 minutes to ensure Morocco took their place in the semifinals. Earlier in the competition, Morocco had topped Group A with a maximum of nine points after beating Burkina Faso 1-0, Uganda 3-1 and Senegal 1-0. Zambia, who defeated Senegal 4-2 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in Wednesday’s other quarterfinal, will face the winner of the match between Cameroon and Nigeria, which also takes place on Thursday night.
