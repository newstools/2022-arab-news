ISTANBUL: Europe’s top rights court said on Monday that Turkey had not complied with a ruling that called for the release of philanthropist Osman Kavala, moving further in a process that could lead to Ankara’s suspension from the Council of Europe (CoE).
The Committee of Ministers of the CoE, which oversees the implementation of the rulings by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) referred the case back to the court in February.
