RIYADH: The Saudi Council of Health Insurance recently won two awards at the MENA region’s International Transform Awards.
The CHI was granted the golden award for the ‘Best Brand Evolution Strategy’, and won the bronze award for the ‘Best Visual Identity’.
The CHI has uniquely presented its development of its brand while preserving its ties to the past, and has shown its expertise in visual branding.
The Transform Award is the only global award that celebrates the accomplishments of both small and large brands. Brands are rated for their skills within the MENA region.
The Executive Director at the CHI, Rakan Al-Thunayan, stressed that the awards are an
extension of the CHI’s achievements, showing its commitment toward being a global pioneer in creativity and sustainability.
“We were pleased to launch the new identity of the CHI to empower stakeholders and raise the quality and efficiency of health care services provided to beneficiaries,” said Al-Thunayan.
Last month, the CHI participated in the fourth conference of family medicine, Deep Dive 2022, as a diamond sponsor.
The four-day event was developed by highly qualified family medicine physicians and organized by primary care providers, doctors, residents, and interns.
The event was viewed as the most important hub for continuing medical education in the field of primary care and family medicine.
The CHI aims to be a global leader in disease prevention for health insurance beneficiaries through transparency, justice, quality, and efficiency in its services.
