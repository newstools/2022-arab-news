JEDDAH: A 14-year-old teenager, Ritaj Al-Hazmi, remains the titleholder of a Guinness World Record for being the youngest writer of a novel series. She was first named in 2020 by the Guinness Book of Records for this achievement. Al-Hazmi began writing short stories at the age of six with the support of her family, who sent her on special creative writing courses. She published her first two English-language novels “Treasure of the Lost Sea” and “Portal of the Hidden World” in 2019 when she was 10. In 2021, she published her third novel “Beyond the Future World.” She has recently completed a new novel, “The Passage to the Unknown,” and is preparing to publish.   Al-Hazmi said she wants to inspire others to read by producing these works. She told the Saudi Press Agency that she is currently working on a science fiction novel entitled “The Day Before 2050,” about the potential danger of climate change to humans and animals. She recently published an article on the subject, and said she chose the title because 2050 is the date set by many countries to reach net zero emissions. Al-Hazmi remains dedicated to the craft of writing.   “It takes me about a year to write a book, depending on the type of book. The writing mechanism that I follow is one of the most famous international methods called ‘Save The Cat Method,’ which depends on dividing the composition of the novel into main points. Moreover, some electronic applications help me organize my ideas and ensure the correct sequence of events in the novel while writing, and (I) refer to them before the proofreading stage.” Al-Hazmi thanked the government for supporting artists in the country. Her father Hussain Al-Hazmi is proud of her achievements. “Getting this title is one of the most important awards she has received, and I am very happy for her that she has been able to reach her goals and make her dream come true.”
