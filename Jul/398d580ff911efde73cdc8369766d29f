JEDDAH: Yasmine Al-Dabbagh will get Saudi Arabia’s participation off the mark at the 2022 World Athletics Championships in the US when she takes part in the 100-meter sprint on Saturday. The competition, which will run until July 24, also sees the participation of Saudi pole vaulter Hussain Al-Hizam. Runner Mazen Al-Yassin had to pull out due to a last-minute injury. It is 24-year-old Al-Dabbagh’s second international contest, having previously represented the Kingdom at the Tokyo Olympics last summer, also in the 100 meters. Al-Hizam, 24, will make his international debut next Friday when he competes in a field of 32.
