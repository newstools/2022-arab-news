DUBAI: Members of the public in Dubai have been warned against publishing or forwarding videos and images of illegal acts on social media to avoid legal accountability, the emirate's police force said. The warning comes after a video showing a group of men engaged in an armed fight and damaging public property in a Dubai neighborhood went viral on social media. Seven suspects linked to the incident were arrested and referred to public prosecution, as Dubai Police reminded the public that circulating videos of crime scenes or accidents online is punishable by law. #News | Dubai Police arrests Group of People After a Video Shared Online Details:https://t.co/BFxUpXgQZy#YourSecurityOurHappiness pic.twitter.com/pqja0XmopH — Dubai Policeشرطة دبي (@DubaiPoliceHQ) July 21, 2022 Under the UAE’s cybercrime law, violators face at least one year imprisonment and a fine of up to $27,225.
