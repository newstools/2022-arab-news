Since its Parisian opening in 2016, “Glace Bachir” has enjoyed long queues of customers, even in the winter. The ice cream parlor is a popular food destination for the many Lebanese living in Paris, as well as residents and tourists, who have queued in front of ice cream shops to fight the torrid heatwave that has gripped Paris in the last week.
