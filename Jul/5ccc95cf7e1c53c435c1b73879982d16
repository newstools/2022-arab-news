DUBAI: The Dubai government has approved $11.98 million (Dh44 million) worth of new social benefits for Emiratis with disabilities in the emirate.
The benefits will be available for those under 60, who have physical or mental impairments and require support from others, state news agency WAM reported.
Among the new benefits approved by Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, are fees for kindergartens, schools, university programs, and training and rehabilitation centers within specialized institutions, as well as the expenses for teachers, caregivers, personal assistants and sign language interpreters.
The benefits also cover devices and technology, the adjustment of vehicles and the cost of equipping the workplace to accommodate people with disabilities, the report added.
It is hoped more people will benefit from the allowances as the Dubai government continues to  expand its coverage.
