RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Health has revealed details of its 55 health-care facilities in Arafat, dedicated to serving pilgrims during this year’s Hajj. These hospitals and clinics are unique, as they provide their services for one day only during the Hajj season. This year, there are three hospitals — Jabal Al-Rahma, Namira, and East Arafat — with a total capacity of 493 beds. Of those, 108 beds are in intensive care units, 54 in emergency departments, and seven in operating theaters. The hospitals cover all medical specialties. There are also 52 clinics equipped to treat heat stroke, aided by 13 ambulances and 36 paramedic teams.
