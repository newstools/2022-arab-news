ABU DHABI: NYU Abu Dhabi research scientist Dimitra Atri has produced the world’s first ever Mars atlas in Arabic, Emirates News Agency reported. The atlas uses data from the UAE’s Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) — also known as Hope or Al-Amal — in order to make the findings of the probe more accessible to both the UAE’s Arabic-speaking population and the rest of the world. The Mars Atlas Project combines various images from the Hope probe to map the planet’s surface. The end result is a comprehensive view of Mars and stunning images of a planet that once had similar atmospheric conditions to Earth. Atri and his team compiled the atlas by processing observational data from EMM’s Emirates eXploration Imager, one of three instruments onboard the orbiter. The device will also assist the team in showing how the planet changes over the course of one Mars year, which is roughly equivalent to two Earth years. As more data from the Hope probe becomes available, the atlas will be gradually updated. The data will help scientists gain a better understanding of the planet’s atmospheric thinning, which has caused it to cool and dry over the last 4 billion years. Atri predicts that the collected data will be used to answer unsolved scientific questions about the erosion of Mars’ atmosphere. The findings could help the international scientific community to better understand Earth’s atmospheric processes, he said.
