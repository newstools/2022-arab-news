JEDDAH: An esports festival is bringing international musical artists to Riyadh for the eight-week event. The lineup for Gamers8 features DJs, rappers, and singers from the Arab world, Europe, and the US, including Lil Pump, Nancy Ajram, Hamaki, Disco Misr, Alan Walker, Russ, DJ Snake, and Balqees. Artists will perform each weekend for fans and participants. Gamers8, which is the biggest gaming and esports event worldwide, is being brought to the city by the Saudi Esports Federation. Its goal is to blur borders, the ones between countries and the ones between the real world and the virtual one, and to bring gamers together. It is also a step forward in finding gamers, strengthening the gaming community in Saudi Arabia, and introducing them to the rest of the world. A prize purse of up to $15 million is up for grabs. The big-name games at the festival are PUBG, Dota 2, Rocket League, Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege, and Fortnite. The musical performances and children’s activities open the event up to a wider audience, with around 1,000 activities and attractions at Boulevard Riyadh City during the festival. SEF COO Ahmed Al-Bishri said: “The goal of Gamers8 is to bring the virtual world of esports gaming out into the physical realm of Riyadh while merging a plethora of entertainment such as music, festivals, shows, and the latest experiences for children. “We are delighted to be bringing some of the biggest names in music to Riyadh this summer and know they will significantly contribute to a season of incredible moments and memories.” Full details about the performers and festival can be found on gamers8.gg.
