Saudi Arabia finished fourth at the 2022 Asian Men’s Junior Handball Championship after a 27-21 defeat to Kuwait in the bronze medal match on Sunday in Manama. The young Falcons will consider the tournament a success because the last-four finish secures them a place at the 2023 IHF Men’s Junior World Championship to be held in Germany and Greece. The Saudi team had missed out on a place in the final of the tournament after losing 31-26 to hosts Bahrain in the semifinals on Friday. Meanwhile, Japan beat Kuwait 28-26 in the other semifinal and went on to win the competition after beating Bahrain 24-20 in Sunday night’s final. The eight-team continental tournament in the Bahraini capital doubled up as a qualifying campaign for next year’s global event, to be held from June 20 to July 2. The Saudi team secured a spot at the world championships for the fourth time in its history following their 32-28 win over South Korea in the final group match to reach the semifinals. Saudi Arabia previously played at the event in 1979, 1999 and 2017.
