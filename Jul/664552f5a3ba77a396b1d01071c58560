Al-Hilal’s Argentine coach Ramon Diaz is keen to retain the full complement of foreign players that helped the club win a record extending 18th Saudi Pro League title, Arabic language daily Arriyadiyah has reported. Diaz took control of the Riyadh giants in winter, and also led them through to the qualifying stages of the AFC Champions League. According to sources close to the club, Al-Hilal’s management has not yet decided on the future of Argentine Luciano Vietto, who has been loaned from Al-Shabab. The matter is now expected to be resolved with the start of Al-Hilal’s preparations for the new season. The Saudi and Asian champions will begin their pre-season preparations on July 23 by conducting medical examinations of the players, before leaving for a training camp in the English city of Birmingham five days later.
