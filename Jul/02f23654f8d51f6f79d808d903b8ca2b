Olympic and world high jump champion Mutaz Barshim will lead Qatar’s bid for glory at the 2022 World Athletics Championships taking place in Oregon, US, from July 14-24. The 31-year-old memorably took the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics, where he shared first place with Italian jumper Gianmarco Tamberi. His only participation since came in May at the Diamond League 2022 season-opening round in Doha, where he finished second with a jump of 2.30 m behind South Korean Woo Sanghyeok, who managed 2.33 m. Barshim’s participation was assured in Oregon having won the 2019 title in Doha. Previously, the Qatari was crowned champion of the 2017 edition in London, finished fourth in Beijing 2015, second in Moscow 2013, and seventh in Daegu 2011. Khalid Rashid Al-Marri, executive director of the Qatar Athletics Federation, said in an interview with Qatar News Agency: “Barshim’s preparations were carried out according to what was planned, and proceeded as usual before any participation in a tournament.” He described the Olympic champion as “professional enough to know his targets, and know the goal of every sporting competition he participates in.”
