CAIRO: The US has pledged $50 million (947 million Egyptian pounds) to strengthen Egypt’s food security and help the country offset the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. US President Joe Biden made the pledge during a meeting with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. Subject to approval by the US Congress, the $50 million in funding will, among other things, support Egypt’s smallholder farmers, according to the US Embassy in Cairo. “Building on more than 40 years of partnership and over $1.4 billion in US assistance to Egypt’s agricultural sector, the US government stands in solidarity with the people of Egypt at this crucial moment,” Nicole Shampaine, US chargé d’affaires in Cairo, said in a statement. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has disrupted agricultural supply lines, leading to increased food insecurity and higher food costs worldwide.
