Groups of pilgrims from Turkey, Europe, the US and Australia have begun leaving Makkah after performing Hajj, bound for Madinah where they will visit the Prophet’s Mosque. Zuhair Mohammed Khattab Shaker, the managing director of the Hajj service for the pilgrims from these areas, said that the process for those who travel from Makkah to Madinah, or to Jeddah from where they will depart for their homelands, is carried out in accordance with approved official procedures. These procedures offer pilgrims the chance to perform one last tawaf around the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque and include regular bus services to take the pilgrims to their next destination, he said. The departure of pilgrims is facilitated by Al-Rifada (Hajj service) centers, using workers provided by the General Syndicate of Cars to transport luggage, which means that pilgrims do not have to personally visit the offices of authorities to complete departure procedures themselves.
