DAMMAM: The fourth edition of the International Video Art Forum, organized by the Saudi Arabian Society for Culture and Arts in Dammam, will kick off on Tuesday. Twenty-three countries are exhibiting 49 artworks at the society’s headquarters under the concept “Contemplate Light ... Move Towards Imagination.” The five-day forum provides a visual review of video arts and contemporary artistic and visual perception. Yousef Al-Harbi, the society’s director, said this year’s exhibition received 128 applications from 34 countries. After screening, the committee — which included artists, critics, and specialists in this field — selected 49 works from 23 countries. The forum’s events will include lectures and seminars on video art, the movement associated with it globally, and the most prominent achievements of this modern art in the region. There will also be a book launch. The society established a training institute in 2018 to promote culture and arts. The “Institute of Culture and Arts for Training” or “Thaqqif ” is aimed at creating an environment conducive to the advancement of culture and arts in the Kingdom.
