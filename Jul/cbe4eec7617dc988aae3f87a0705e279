MOSCOW: Alphabet’s Google was fined $387 million (21.8 billion roubles) by a Russian court for a repeated failure to remove content that Moscow deems illegal, the Interfax news agency reported on Monday.
It was the second fine based on a percentage of Google’s turnover in Russia after a penalty worth more than more than 7 billion roubles late last year.
Google did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
