Al-Nassr Club announced the signing of Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina on a two-year contract with the option of a third. The 33-year-old stopper had become a free agent after his contract with Napoli expired at the end of last season, and he becomes Al-Nassr’s second signing of the summer after Ivorian left-back Ghislain Konan. Al-Nassr is Ospina’s fifth professional club, having started out at Colombia’s Atletico Nacional in 2006, before going to represent Nice and Arsenal. Last season, Ospina played 33 times for Napoli, including 31 games in Serie A, one in the Italian Cup, and one in the Europa League; he conceded 28 goals and kept 13 clean sheets. Ospina won the Colombian title twice with Atletico (2006-2007, 2007-2008), the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2015 and 2017, and the Charity Shield with the Gunners in 2018. In 2020 he claimed an Italian Cup winners medal with Napoli. Ospina made his international debut for Colombia in 2007, and went on to represent his country 124 times, breaking the previous record held by Carlos Valderrama. He was part of Colombia’s squads at the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cups.
