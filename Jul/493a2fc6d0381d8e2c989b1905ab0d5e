LONDON: Spotify on Monday rolled out a real-time lyrics feature on Google Nest Hub that lets users listen to music while seeing a stream of lyrics accompanying the song. Previously available on iOS, Android, game consoles, desktop computers and select smart TVs, the feature was not formally announced by the music streaming platform, but users reported spotting real-time lyrics on their Nest Hub devices. To access the feature on Google Nest Hub, users must tap the lyrics icon appearing in the bottom-right corner of the screen when selecting a song. Once enabled, lyrics remain turned on until manually disabled, as such changing tracks on Spotify will not turn off lyrics. As songs come to an end, Spotify notes that lyrics are “Licensed & Provided by MusixMatch,” the same provider as on other platforms. The feature was first introduced in 2018 when Spotify launched real-time lyrics globally in 2021. Initially, the company tested the feature in select markets such as South America, Central America and Asia. However, in November 2021, Spotify finally brought the feature to all markets across numerous  devices and platforms. As part of its efforts to become a platform for creative exchange between fans and creators, Spotify introduced a host of new features, including the song lyrics feature, to boost its popularity among users. Most recently, Spotify launched Clips, which allows listeners to watch exclusive messages and stories from artists posted in the form of videos, which acts as an equivalent of Instagram Stories on a Spotify playlist.
