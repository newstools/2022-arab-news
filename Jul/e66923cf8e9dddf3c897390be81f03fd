The president briefed the pope on the latest developments in the Palestinian territories, especially in the occupied city of Jerusalem, the official Wafa news agency reported. He also briefed Pope Francis on the attacks on Christian and Islamic sanctities, especially in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Israeli practices of expelling Palestinians from their homes in the neighborhoods of Jerusalem, assaulting their property, and daily killings, particularly the case of slain journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.
