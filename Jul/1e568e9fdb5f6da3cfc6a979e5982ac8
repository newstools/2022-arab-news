MAKKAH: After a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic, the Saudi Health Ministry is taking bedridden pilgrims from Madinah hospitals to the holy sites in Makkah so that they can perform Hajj. The ministry said that the convoy, which took off at dawn on Tuesday, consists of 10 ambulances equipped with medical equipment, along with a specialized medical team consisting of doctors, nurses and paramedics, in addition to five empty spare ambulances, an intensive care ambulance, an oxygen cabin, a mobile first-aid unit, and a bus to transport the patients’ companions. Every year, the ministry transfers bedridden pilgrims from Madinah hospitals to the holy sites so that they can fulfill their Hajj rituals and complete their treatment in the hospitals of the holy sites after providing them with medical services in Madinah hospitals. Pilgrims expressed appreciation for the help provided to perform Hajj despite their health conditions.
