DUBAI: It was a night to remember as part-Palestinian supermodel Gigi Hadid, the newest Self-Portrait brand ambassador, played host at the British Vogue X Self-Portrait summer party. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle Held at Chiltern Firehouse, the supermodel showed up in a lime-green, figure-hugging dress from Self-Portrait. She completed the look with matching metallic heels and Self-Portrait’s new-season Bow bag — creative director Han Chong’s first bag design. Other famous names also made it to the party, including Celeste, Mj Rodriguez, designers Harris Reed and Chet Lo, Little Simz, Kai-Isaiah Jamal and Bimini Bon-Boulash. Meanwhile, Sabrina Elba, Bukky Bakray and models Aweng Chuol, Devon Ross and Ella Richards were also dressed by Self-Portrait.  A post shared by SELF-PORTRAIT (@mrselfportrait) Earlier this week, Hadid was revealed as the face of the brand’s newest campaign, which captures the model over the course of a day in her hometown of New York wearing pieces from the new collection, transitioning from day to night. The campaign will evolve through the season, starting with six images, with further pictures from Hadid’s day in NYC to be added as the weeks go by. On the new campaign, Chong said: “I’ve always wanted to capture a day in the life of the Self-Portrait woman so when exploring how best to present our Autumn/Winter 2022 collection, doing just that seemed like the perfect opportunity. Gigi was the perfect woman to bring this idea to life — free-spirited, hard-working and a true ray of sunshine — she brought an effortless energy to this campaign.”
