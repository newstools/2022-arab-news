CAIRO: A video of a farewell party held by a Saudi businessman and his family to an Egyptian expat who spent 40 years working in their service has triggered a wave of emotional reactions on social media in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Saudi businessman Khaled Al-Saud bid farewell for Egyptian expat Shawky Abbas Samman at his residence in Mecca in the presence of friends and family. The video, shot by one of Al-Saud's friends and uploaded on TikTok, showed the Saudi man kissing Shawky’s head in a gesture of appreciation, and his sons kneeling to kiss the expat’s hand as a show of gratitude to his efforts over the years.
