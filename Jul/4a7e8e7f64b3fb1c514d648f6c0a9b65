JEDDAH: The Islamic World Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization will hold an international forum on space sciences from July 18 to 22, under the theme “Building Tomorrow’s Global Workforce.” The forum will be held in partnership with the International University of Rabat and Cadi Ayyad University in Marrakesh, Morocco and will take place both virtually and in ICESCO’s Rabat headquarters. Participants will include international experts and officials, astronauts, students and researchers in the field from the Muslim world and beyond, according to a press release. The forum will include a satellite design workshop based on the CanSat initiative, which challenges students to build and launch a mini satellite; an exploration of how to facilitate the integration of space-related curricula into universities; as well as discussions on how to boost collaboration between educational institutes and the space industry in developing countries and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship among university-based space-science researchers. ICESCO consists of 54 member states and three observer states spread across four regions — Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and South America. Further information on the forum is available on ICESCO’s website.
