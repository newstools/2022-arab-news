DUBAI: Two bears made themselves at home after entering a woman’s house in California and helping themselves with sweet treats, the homeowner told ABC news.  
A mama bear and her cub entered a Monrovia home on Tuesday, as seen in a video taken by a southern California resident, that showed the bears rummaging through the kitchen in search for a tasty snack.
They later snatched some donuts on top of the counter and exited the house through the window.  
It did not seem that the hungry bears have noticed the person filming them on camera as they sneaked in. 
The homeowners said this was the second time the same bears have broken through their home in search for food.
