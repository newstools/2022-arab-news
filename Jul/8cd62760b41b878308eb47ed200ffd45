Madinah is home to a number of mosques and historic Islamic sites, a veritable tourist destination where visitors can explore places from Prophet Muhammad’s life. Al-Jum’ah Mosque is one such place, linked to the migration of Prophet Muhammad from Makkah to Madinah. The mosque is the site where the prophet stopped in the Wadi Ranuna region and performed the Jum’ah, or Friday, prayer. Al-Jum’ah Mosque holds different names, such as Al-Wadi Mosque and Atikah Mosque. As a site of historical significance with a prominent role in Islamic history, today it sees a number of visitors who come to perform their prayers. It is situated southwest of Madinah, near Wadi Ranuna, 900 meters north of the Quba Mosque and 6 kilometers from the Prophet’s Mosque. It was built with rocks initially then demolished and renovated several times. Before the last expansion, the mosque was built over a small mound, with one dome made of red bricks. Then it was rebuilt and expanded to accommodate 650 pilgrims. The mosque also includes a minaret, a main dome in the middle of a praying area and four small domes on its sides.
