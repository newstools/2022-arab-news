RIYADH: The Imam Turki bin Abdullah Royal Natural Reserve is home to the largest species of ostrich in the world, Saudi Press Agency reported on Thursday. The common ostrich, or simply ostrich, is a species of flightless bird native to certain large areas of Africa and is the largest living bird species. An adult male may be 2.74 meters tall and the female is somewhat smaller. They can travel at a speed of 50 kilometers per hour, and ostriches are the only birds in the world with two toes. Ostriches typically eat plants, roots, and seeds but will also eat insects, lizards, or other creatures available in their sometimes harsh habitat.
