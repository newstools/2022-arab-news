For the new releases, the couturier drew inspiration from “the connection to the city,” according to a released statement. Set against the backdrop of the iconic Arc de Triomphe and Eiffel Tower, the new designs are in rich hues of blue, silver, green, brown and gold that contrast the city’s grey and anthracite stones. Here are six standout looks from Chakra’s 49-piece collection: Velvet tubes  The celebrity-loved couturier opened the show with a jacket with a plunging neckline, made from intricate velvet tubes meticulously twisted with tiered silk faille sleeves. In red  The red flowing dress features a floor-length train and a thigh-high slit. It is decorated with feathers around the waist. Woven gown  One of the show’s highlights is a fully sequinned silver dress that has a woven, trapped black collar and a square neckline. Sparkly ensemble  Chakra’s collection not only features a red-carpet gown, but also tailored trousers and glitzy tops. He matched black trousers with a one-shouldered top with a puffy sleeve and a floor-length train. Satin set  The eye-grabbing satin set gives royal elegance. The suit features straight-leg trousers and an off-the shoulder structured top with ruffles at the shoulders. Bridal dream  The designer closed off the show with a luxurious bridal gown. For this collection, he opted for a column cream-colored gown of rose gold lace with fluttering tinsel sequins, encased in cream tulle with a long train lined in duchesse satin.
