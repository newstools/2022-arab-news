RIYADH: Unemployed, bored and waiting for his medical license, Dr. Amr Al-Sabban thought to share simple medical facts through short, entertaining videos on social media. “I wanted to make content that everybody could understand and benefit from. At first, it was challenging because I had no clue how to take a good video that would attract people’s attention, but with time I learned the skills. I am always striving to improve my content,” Al-Sabban told Arab News. While creating videos for his social media platform, Al-Sabban initially faced a few challenges, such as simplifying complex medical information so that a layperson could understand. I generally talk about common medical issues, dispel rumors and try to promote a healthy lifestyle. I research using authentic sources. Then I try to simplify the content to exclude jargon and complicated explanations and replace them with simpler everyday words. Dr. Amr Al-Sabban “There were many other obstacles I faced such as quality issues, misleading research, irritating followers who were looking for trouble and followers who didn’t engage with my work as well,” he said. With time, however, he was able to overcome these challenges and produce quality content. “I generally talk about common medical issues, dispel rumors and try to promote a healthy lifestyle. I research using authentic sources. Then I try to simplify the content to exclude jargon and complicated explanations and replace them with simpler everyday words,” he explained. “After that, I practice, rehearse and shoot until I am satisfied with the results. Then I upload it, and when I get feedback or questions, I try to answer them as soon as possible.” Al-Sabban urges people with a medical background to step up and put social media platforms to good use by sharing informative and accurate content with netizens.
