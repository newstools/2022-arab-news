MINA: The Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has hailed the safe movement of pilgrims during rituals after a campaign to use cutting-edge technology to monitor crowd movements in Makkah. The campaign, held in partnership with all public authorities during the Hajj season, includes the use of field surveillance cameras, smartphone applications and a smart Hajj platform, enabling pilgrims to perform their rituals in ease and comfort. A number of grouping processes have been launched this Hajj, beginning from the arrival of pilgrims to the moment of departure. The ministry revisits its performance indicators to make amendments to its organizational plans throughout the season. Plans to arrange pilgrim movement from tents to the Bridge of Jamarat on Sunday were successful, the ministry said. It added that plans on the first day of Tashreeq were closely monitored by surveillance cameras amid coordination with the other Hajj-relevant authorities. The movement of pilgrims during the stoning of the three pillars was smooth, the ministry said, adding that pilgrims cooperated with instructions and pre-scheduled timings. The Hajj and Umrah Ministry demanded that Hajj service companies refuse pilgrims who carried personal belongings when leaving their tents for the stoning ritual. It also encouraged service companies to assign a leader for every group of 90 pilgrims.
