DUBAI: Adding to its Ultimate collection just in time for Eid Al Adha, Assouline Publishing has launched a new book, “Hajj and The Arts of Pilgrimage,” a compendium that takes an in-depth look at one of the biggest gatherings in the world. Featuring chapters on the Islamic principles of Hajj, travel, rituals, sacred manuscripts, textiles, souvenirs and Western perspectives, the richly-illustrated volume narrates and reveals the broad spiritual, cultural and artistic aspects of the pilgrimage to Makkah and Medina.   Told exclusively through the Khalili Collection of Hajj and the Arts of Pilgrimage by its curator Qaisra M. Khan, formerly of the British Museum, the book has been specially compiled for those who are unfamiliar with Islamic practices. The Khalili Collection comprises some 5,000 objects covering all aspects of Hajj, from the eighth to the 21st century, and geographically from China to India and around the globe to Morocco and the UK.
