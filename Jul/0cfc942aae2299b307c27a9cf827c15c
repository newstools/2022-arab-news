AQABA: The International Transport Workers’ Federation Arab World has donated  $5,000 to the families of each of the 13 victims of the Aqaba chlorine gas incident, according to the Jordanian Press Agency. The 13 died in June when a tank of liquified chlorine gas ignited after a cable snapped as it was being loaded by a crane. At least 300 others were injured. ITF Arab World Regional Secretary Bilal Malkawi said the financial assistance was given in solidarity with the dock workers who died in the accident, and to send a message of support to the victims’ families from laborers all over the world. Malkawi expressed hope that the port accident investigation will result in “just outcomes,” and he urged Jordanians to advocate for employees in the transportation sector, which he described as “one of the most dangerous for workers.” Meanwhile, the victims’ families expressed gratitude for the gesture, saying they are “waiting for fair results.” Environment Minister Muawiya Radaydah said a few days after the incident that the air and water in the port city were free of chlorine gas.
