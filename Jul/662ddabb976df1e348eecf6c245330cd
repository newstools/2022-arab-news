Jeddah: The Transport General Authority has offered electric scooters as a new transportation service for pilgrims during this year’s Hajj season. This new service aims at improving pilgrims’ experience, facilitating their movements while performing their rituals, and reducing the duration of their trips from Mount Arafat to Muzdalifah. A journey by electric scooter saves 15 minutes for a distance that previously required walking for around an hour, with specific paths that are designated for scooters and maintaining safety. The service has helped enrich the experience for many pilgrims. The TGA established a specialized team to raise awareness about using the scooters, and the authority will work on developing and improving the service for future Hajj seasons. This comes as part of the TGA’s role in providing diverse transport options and adopting modern technology to offer pilgrims the best possible experience, and to ensure their safe mobility while performing their rituals.
