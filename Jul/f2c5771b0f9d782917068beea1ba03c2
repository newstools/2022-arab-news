RIYADH: Saudi Arabia on Thursday strongly condemned a terrorist attack on a military in southeast Niger that killed and injured a number of security forces, the Kingdom’s foreign ministry said.
Suspected militants killed six soldiers and wounded 14 others in an attack on early Tuesday on a military post of the Nigerien National Guard in Blabrine, in the Diffa region, which borders Chad and Nigeria.
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs renewed the Kingdom’s full support for Niger in its intensified efforts to eliminate terrorism and extremism in all its forms and manifestations and dry up its sources of financing,” it said in a statement.
“The Kingdom stands with the government and people of Niger against all terrorist organizations that are trying to undermine Niger’s gains and capabilities,” the ministry added.
It expressed the Kingdom’s sincere condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims, and to the Nigerien government and people, wishing the injured a speedy recovery, and continued security and stability for the West African country.(With AFP)
