The individual investor subscription period is scheduled to start on July 20 and to close on July 21. The Capital Market Authority approved on June 7 Alamar’s application to offer 10.63 million shares, or 41.7 percent of the company’s capital, to the public. Alamar’s capital stands at SR255 million.
