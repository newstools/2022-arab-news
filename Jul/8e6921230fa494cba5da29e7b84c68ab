JEDDAH: Saudi Arabia’s project to benefit from sacrifices announced the success of its operational plan for this year’s Hajj season, by integrating with all relevant governmental and private sectors, Saudi Press Agency reported on Tuesday.
Adahi said that with the sunset of the third day of Tashreeq, the implementation of the pilgrims’ rituals for this year has been completed, and distribution operations will start at home and abroad over the coming days.

Adahi expressed its thanks and appreciation to King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the unlimited support they provide to the project, which was dedicated to serving pilgrims in carrying out their rituals in a legitimate and healthy manner.
