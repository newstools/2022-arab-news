The Egyptian Football Association has officially announced that the Rui Vitoria has signed a four-year contract as the new coach of the national team and will take charge of the team ahead of the upcoming qualifiers for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations. According to Egyptian media outlets on Tuesday, the Portuguese coach will receive a monthly salary of about $200,000, will work with his four chosen assistants, and will remain in charge until 2026 if the team achieves positive results during coming period. Vitoria — whose last job was at Russian giants Spartak Moscow in 2021 — had received an offer to train the Egyptian club Al-Ahly, but after negotiations broke down between the two parties, the 52-year-old reached an agreement with Hazem Emam, a member of the Board of Directors of the Egyptian Football Association, to take over as coach of the Pharaohs. Vitoria previously managed Benfica (2015-2019) and Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia from January 2019 until December 2020. During his brief stint in the Kingdom, he won the Saudi Pro League and the Saudi Super Cup.
