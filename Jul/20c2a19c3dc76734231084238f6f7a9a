RIYADH: Umrah pilgrims will be able to book their slots and issue permits online starting from July 30, reported Saudi News Agency (SPA), citing the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah. Through a color-coded system on the “Eatmarna” app, pilgrims will be able to book their slot based on the capacity of the Grand Mosque in Makkah, said SPA. Under the Kingdom’s health guidelines, pilgrims will have their permits cancelled if they test positive for COVID-19 or are proven to be a patient’s close contact on the “Tawakkalna” app. Pilgrims performing Umrah will have to wear masks inside the Grand Mosque in Makkah, leave the site by the end of their permit, and refrain from carrying unauthorized luggage inside the mosque, reported SPA. And the “Eatmarna” app will enable pilgrims to issue Hajj permits in easy steps, the ministry said.
