The financial sector sub-index eased 0.17 percent, the consumer staples sector dropped 0.81 percent, and the health care sub-index tumbled 3.17 percent.

Investors are also skeptical about whether loss-making Freshippo can keep growing and turn a profit anytime soon, given the company’s bleak outlook as the world’s second-largest economy continues to pursue a strict policy of stamping out COVID-19 cases, the report cited. The supermarket chain, known as Hema in Chinese, aims to raise $400 million to $500 million from outside investors.
