LONDON: Lebanon’s basketball team fell at the final hurdle in the FIBA Asia Cup final after going down 75-73 to Australia in Jakarta on Sunday evening. It followed three quarters during which Australia were dominant, and Lebanon found themselves trailing by 14 points heading into the fourth and final quarter. But a dramatic and brave late rally from the Cedars saw them get to within one point of their opponents with just five seconds to play. Wael Arakji, the top scorer in the match with 28 points, was named the tournament’s MVP. Amid ongoing economic hardship back home, the team’s remarkable run to the final had given hope to Lebanese people around the world.
