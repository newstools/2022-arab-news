DUBAI: Seven people were pronounced dead in the UAE after heavy floods hit the northern and eastern regions of the country, the Ministry of Interior said. Authorities offered condolences to the families of the victims, who were of Asian nationalities. In a video update posted on Twitter, the ministry said efforts are ongoing to evacuate impacted residents to government-provided shelters after floods caused major damage to homes and properties. “Nearly 80% of individuals whose homes have been exposed to floods over the past two days have returned to their homes,” said Brig. Gen. Ali Salem Al-Tunaiji, director-general of Federal Central Operations at the Ministry of Interior. “Authorities are continuing their gradual recovery efforts, in light of the recent rain- and wind-induced weather fluctuations,” Al-Tunaiji said. He was delivering the statement on the developments related to rescue and assistance operations in areas affected by the turbulent weather conditions in the country, especially in Fujairah, Sharjah and Ras Al-Khaimah. Fujairah has been one of the most impacted after recording the highest rainfall the country has seen in 27 years. The ministry noted that all entities and parties involved are working together to facilitate return to normalcy and open closed roads, noting that there is only one road that remains closed, with work currently underway to dispose of remaining water. Moreover, community police have made relentless efforts in providing psychological support to those affected, he added. Meanwhile, the National Emergency, Crisis and Disasters Management Authority (Ncema) said Thursday at least 870 people were rescued after flash floods hit UAE’s northern Emirates, with 3,897 individuals placed in temporary shelters in Fujairah and Sharjah.
