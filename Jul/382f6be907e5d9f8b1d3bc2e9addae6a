RIYADH: Egypt on Thursday claimed a 1-0 victory over Oman in their opening match of the 2022 Arab Cup U20 at the Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Stadium in Abha. The evening match was part of Group D of the 18-team tournament which will run until Aug. 6. The Pharaohs took the lead through a 43rd-minute goal by Ahmed Nader, and although Oman came back strongly in the second half there would be no change in the score, with Egypt’s Raafat Khalil nominated the player of the match. The result leaves Egypt as early leaders of the three-team group with three points, while Oman are bottom. Oman will next take on Somalia on Sunday before Egypt face the same opposition the following Wednesday.
