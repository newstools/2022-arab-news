During the meeting, the minister praised Al-Issa’s sermon for its clear-sighted explanation of the wisdom of Islam. Al-Issa also met Iraqi Minister of Hajj Sami Al-Masoudi to discuss the prospects for increased joint cooperation. Al-Masoudi praised efforts by the Kingdom to ensure the success of Hajj and expressed his appreciation of Al-Issa’s message in the Arafat sermon. The MWL chief held a meeting with Jordanian Minister of Awfaq Mohammed Al-Khalayleh to discuss key Islamic issues. Al-Khalayleh congratulated Al-Issa on a successful Hajj. Al-Issa, who delivered the Arafat sermon for the first time, emphasized the importance of Islam’s five pillars of faith. He said that good deeds would guarantee happiness in life and ensure Allah’s rewards in the hereafter. He urged Muslims to continue to carry out good deeds and treat others well, including those of other beliefs. “All people, whether Muslims or not, respect those with good manners, for sound conduct is a high human value,” he said. Al-Issa urged the faithful to distance themselves from actions that can cause disharmony, hatred and division. “Love and compassion should prevail in our dealings, and it is part of our faith that we all together unite,” he said, adding that cooperation can preserve cohesion within the Muslim world.
