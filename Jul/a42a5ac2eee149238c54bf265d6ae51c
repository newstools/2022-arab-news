Jordanian Prime Minister, Bishr al-Khasawneh, said on Sunday that the Director General of the Ports Management and Operations Company and a group of officials in the company have been dismissed due to findings of the Aqaba gas leak incident. Thirteen people were killed, including at least four Asian migrants, when toxic chlorine gas escaped on the dockside in the Jordanian Red Sea port of Aqaba last week. The Director General of the Maritime Authority has also been dismissed following the report's findings. Khasawneh said that the Aqaba incident report will be referred to the Public Prosecution. He added that the investigation found major "inability and failure in safety procedures and dealing with hazardous materials in the port." The results of the investigation will be announced with full transparency to public opinion.
