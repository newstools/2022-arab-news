LONDON: FC Barcelona announced on Thursday the launch of the first non-fungible token (NFT) artwork in the football club’s history, a recreation of Johan Cruyff’s legendary stadium moment in December 1973. Titled “In a Way, Immortal,” the NFT has been produced by the club in collaboration with BCN Visuals, a digital studio that developed the NFT’s aesthetic. The NFT, which will be live auctioned at Sotheby’s New York on July 29 alongside four other NFTs, recreates Cruyff’s legendary moment when the iconic Dutch player “flew” through the air to score a seminal goal against Atlético Madrid goalkeeper Miguel Reina. In addition to the artwork, the buyer of this NFT will also be gifted a number of VIP club-based benefits and experiences and will be named a Barça Digital Ambassador. People took to social media to share their reactions to the launch, with one user saying: “Keep innovating and pushing the boundaries. Let the haters hate. Visca Barca!”  Keep innovating and pushing the boundaries. Let the haters hate.

With the launch of this collection, the Spanish football club hopes to attract a younger audience with the “aim of both educating and inspiring its millennial, xennial and generation Z supporters, among others.” FC Barcelona is not the first football club to have launched an NFTs collection. Last March, Liverpool FC launched a Limited Edition NFT featuring an animated version of its top players.
