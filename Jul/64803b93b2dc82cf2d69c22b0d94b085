RIYADH: The Masam project for clearing mines in Yemen dismantled, during the last week of June 2022, a total of 1,143 mines planted by the Houthi militia across Yemen.
This included eight anti-personnel mines, 312 anti-tank mines, 777 unexploded ordnance and 46 explosive devices.
Since the beginning of the project, as many as 348,883 mines have been dismantled.
Saudi Arabia is focusing on assisting the Yemeni people as a top priority.
In May, the supervisor general of King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center discussed the humanitarian situation in the country with the charge d’affaires of the US Embassy in Riyadh.
During the meeting, Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah and Martina Strong also discussed ways to address the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the health risks posed to countries in need.
Strong commended the great humanitarian work carried out by KSrelief and noted the fruitful partnership between the center and the US Agency for International Development.
