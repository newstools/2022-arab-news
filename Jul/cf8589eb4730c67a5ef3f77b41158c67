The town where the showcase took place was founded by the Moors who arrived in the Middle Ages and gave the village its name, Marsa Al-Hamen, which translates to “harbor of the turtle doves.” A post shared by Dolce&Gabbana (@dolcegabbana) The designers employed the same techniques they had used for the women’s collection, which was shown to a star-studded audience earlier this week, including voluminous gathered bustles of satin, sharply pleated chiffon, and corsetry. “The #DGAltaSartoria Collection tells a story of eternal life. Bold structures handmade from mythological inspirations frame the male forms, enhancing the anatomy as if they were forged on the bodies themselves,” the label wrote on Instagram.
