MAKKAH: A massive sprinkler system with over 8,000 water posts has been set up at the holy sites to help cool pilgrims and reduce dust in the atmosphere. This is according to the Kidana Development Co., which stated that these posts sprinkle 230,000 cubic meters of water, supported by a pipe network of over 190,000 meters. They will operate for 15 hours a day over a period of 13 days. The Royal Commission for Makkah and the Holy Sites administers the system. Hussain Al-Qahtani, spokesperson for the National Center of Meteorology, said that the system is operational along all the major walking routes at the holy sites. He said pilgrims should check the data provided by the center so that they can choose safe times to perform their rituals. Al-Qahtani said the elderly should attempt to avoid the midday heat, to prevent fatigue and sunstroke. He said that other smart solutions adopted by the government has been to use paint in some walking areas at the holy sites that absorb heat and help reduce temperatures. Al-Qahtani said many pilgrims have avoided the high temperatures by staying in their tents.
