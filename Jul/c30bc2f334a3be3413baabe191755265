JEDDAH: Saudi authorities foiled an attempt to smuggle millions of highly addictive and illegal amphetamine pills into the country, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Friday. In a report, the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority said that almost 15 million Captagon tablets were found hidden in a commercial consignment coming from abroad via Jeddah Islamic Port. The report said that the smuggled quantity was found hidden in a machine designed to manufacture concrete blocks. The authority notified security officials who, after tracing the address of the single beneficiary, apprehended him. The Ministry of Interior and various security agencies, working with the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority, continues to target those trying to smuggle drugs into the country. Last month, the General Directorate of Narcotics Control foiled two attempts to smuggle more than 7 million amphetamine pills, which were found hidden in two separate shipments of building materials, stones and gardening supplies, at Jeddah Islamic Port. The Saudi government has urged anyone with information related to suspected smuggling operations or customs violations to call the confidential hotline 1910, the international number 00 966 114208417, or email 1910@zatca.gov.sa.
