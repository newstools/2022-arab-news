CAIRO: The Arabic translation of the sixth Global Environment Outlook was launched on Thursday by the Arab League, in cooperation with the UN Environment Program and the Center for Environment and Development for the Arab Region and Europe, the Qatar News Agency reported. Mahmoud Fathallah, the Arab League’s director of environment and meteorology, said that the publication of the GEO-6 report in Arabic presents a tremendous opportunity for those in the Middle East involved with environmental issues. He added that the translation reflects the ongoing cooperation between the Arab League and its partners from the UN and CEDARE, and offers decision-makers and environmental experts in the Arab region a perfect opportunity to review and discuss its findings. COP27, the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference, will take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, in November, and the UAE will host the event next year, Fathallah noted, adding that there is growing interest in environmental issues on a global scale. The GEO-6 report, originally published in English in 2019, emphasizes the need to address environmental degradation worldwide through laws that address the primary causes, and to support changes in global waste, food and energy systems by 2050. It adds that if such steps are taken thoughtfully and responsibly, they will have positive effects on social, economic and environmental conditions in the region.
