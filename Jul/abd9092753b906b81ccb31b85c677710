RIYADH: NEOM, the $500-billion megacity expected to change the face of Saudi Arabia, is looking for project managers to build its hotels in the Gulf of Aqaba, MEED reported. The Gulf of Aqaba is a 120-kilometer-long coastal strip at NEOM. It has an average width of 3.5 kilometers, with a total land area of 430 sq. km. This project’s scope includes developing a series of hotels, including the plans for a project named Gas Station Hotel. According to the report, Gas Station Hotel includes two 500-meter-tall hotel towers on either side of the main highway serving the development and a low-rise resort. NEOM is one of the Kingdom’s flagship projects to transform the region, as it plans to move away from an oil-dependent economy. Aimed at functioning as a tourist destination as outlined in Vision 2030, NEOM will be a smart city, adopting all advanced technologies. Some of the notable highlights of the NEOM project include NEOM Bay, NEOM Bay Airport, and NEOM Industrial City.
