RIYADH: Shares of Saudi Jarir Marketing Co., known as Jarir Bookstore, climbed 0.26 percent during early trading on Sunday, despite posting a decline in first-half profits. The share price reached SR151.8 ($40) at 10:50 a.m. Saudi time, compared with SR151.2 at Thursday’s close. The retail giant saw its profits drop by 6 percent during the first half of 2022, on the back of lower sales. The company’s net profit dropped to SR428.5 million ($114 million), compared to SR456.9 million in the previous year, according to bourse filings. This decline was caused by a 5.5 percent drop in sales compared to the same period last year along with higher marketing and sales expenses.
