Author: Hans Belting In this groundbreaking book, renowned art historian Hans Belting proposes a new anthropological theory for interpreting human picture making. Rather than focus exclusively on pictures as they are embodied in various media such as painting, sculpture, or photography, he links pictures to our mental images and therefore our bodies. The body is understood as a “living medium” that produces, perceives, or remembers images that are different from the images we encounter through handmade or technical pictures.
