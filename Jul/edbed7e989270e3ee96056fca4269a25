Diplomatic Adviser to the President of the UAE, Anwar Gargash said that Abu Dhabi was sending an ambassador to Tehran and wants to rebuild relations, Al Arabiya TV reported on Friday. "Abu Dhabi is not open to establishing an axis against any country in the region, especially Iran," Gargash said. Abu Dhabi is open to anything that protects the UAE without targeting a third country, he said. "The idea of a confrontational approach with Iran is not something the UAE embraces," the diplomatic adviser said, even if Tehran's actions in the region were not helping diplomatic efforts.
