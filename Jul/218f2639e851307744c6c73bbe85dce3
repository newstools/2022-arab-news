LONDON: Blackburn Rovers will once again be opening their doors to the Muslim community to host the Eid-Al-Adha prayer on Saturday. Rovers became the first football club in the UK to host the Eid Al-Fitr prayers in May, which marked the end of Ramadan. The event will begin at 9.30 a.m. local time at Ewood Park. More than 3,000 people are expected to attend the event. "Eid @ Ewood Park" is open to all ages, with facilities for both men and women to pray on the pitch. There will also be free on-site parking and a complimentary bus service. The event is supported by "Eid in the Park," a three-day festival held in four different locations across the UK. As such, the event will follow Saudi Arabia for moonsighting.
