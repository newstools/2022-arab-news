DUBAI: UAE carrier flydubai suspended operations to Colombo in Sri Lanka until further notice amid political unrest, a company spokesperson told Arab News in a statement on Monday. “Flydubai flights between Dubai and Colombo Airport (CMB) have been suspended from 10 July until further notice,” the spokesperson said. “We will continue to closely monitor the situation on the ground in Sri Lanka.” The airline confirmed it would refund passengers who had booked their tickets on the cancelled flights. Demonstrations in Sri Lanka reached new heights on Saturday as thousands of protestors stormed the Presidential Palace, prompting the resignations of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
