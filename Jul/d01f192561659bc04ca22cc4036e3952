RIYADH: An initiative to welcome visitors and pilgrims to the Prophet’s Mosque in Madinah was launched on Thursday, Saudi Press Agency reported. As part of the “Hayyakum” initiative, visitors to the mosque are presented with gifts, Zamzam water, and dates at its various entrances. There is also an opportunity for people to have perfume applied to them. Many Hajj pilgrims are visiting Madinah after performing the annual pilgrimage, and 141,000 pilgrims have visited the holy city in the period after Hajj so far. As well as visiting the mosque and other sites of historic significance, many of the pilgrims visited the International Exhibition and Museum of the Prophet’s Biography and Islamic Civilization. Muslims who wish to perform Umrah will be able to do so at the end of the month after the Kingdom’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah announced last week that the new Umrah season for pilgrims inside and outside the Kingdom begins on July 30. Typically, those who perform Umrah also visit the Prophet’s Mosque in Madinah to pay their respects to him either before or after performing the minor pilgrimage.
