CAIRO: The Egyptian military has organized a training course for special forces scheduled to be part of the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali. The course was organized in cooperation with the Cairo International Center for Conflict Resolution, Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding, which is part of Egypt’s Foreign Ministry. An army spokesman said this comes as a continuation of Egypt’s role in supporting security and stability in Africa, and its participation in peacekeeping forces in many countries. The inaugural session began with a speech by Maj. Gen. Mohamed Mahmoud Awad, commander of the Egyptian Paratroopers Forces. He said the training course reflects Egypt’s keenness to support international and regional peacekeeping missions under the UN umbrella. Ahmed Abdel Latif, director general of the Cairo International Center for Conflict Resolution, Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding, said in his speech that Egypt has a pivotal role in supporting regional and international peace and security without interfering in the internal affairs of countries. Oka Hiroshi, Japan’s ambassador to Egypt, commended the armed forces for their efforts to support international security and stability.
