RIYADH: The US Army Corps of Engineers is preparing to tender a contract to design and build new infrastructure at the King Abdulaziz Naval Base in Jubail, according to a MEED report. The USACE’s Transatlantic Middle East District has already invited contractors to submit information by July 19. The report further noted that the project’s scope includes the construction of piers, a wharf, fueling stations, maintenance, operations and warehousing facilities. The project also includes associated site work and utilities necessary to support the introduction of four multi-mission surface combatant ships at the naval base. According to the report, USACE is looking for contractors who have completed similar projects with a value exceeding $200 million in 24 months in the past five years.
