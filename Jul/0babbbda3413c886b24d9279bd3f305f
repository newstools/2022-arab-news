RIYADH: Stores in Madinah are seeing a surge in pilgrims shopping for gifts as they visit the Prophet’s Mosque and important historical sites in the holy city after performing Hajj. Dozens of gold shops near the Prophet’s Mosque have seen an increase in demand for jewellery, and pilgrims have also been purchasing clothes, prayer mats, rosaries, and different types of dates grown in Madinah.
