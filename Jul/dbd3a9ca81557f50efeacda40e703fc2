Saudi and Asian champions Al-Hilal have no intentions to sell Brazilian midfielder Matheus Pereira, according to a club source, Arabic language daily Arriyadiyah has reported. The player is believed to have received interest from several clubs seeking to buy out his contract, but Al-Hilal’s management want him to see out the term, which runs until 2026. Pereira is expected to be included in Argentine coach Ramon Diaz’s squad for the start of the 2022-23 season. The team will leave for England to undergo a preseason training camp. The 26-year-old joined Al-Hilal in the summer of 2021 from English club West Bromwich Albion, and last season took part in 34 matches in all competitions, scoring three goals and providing 15 assists.
