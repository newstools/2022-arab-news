RIYADH: The Saudi main index, TASI, sank to its second-largest monthly decline in 2022 in the final session of June, led by fears of interest rate hikes hitting investors’ optimism. TASI ended June losing 11 percent, to reach 11,523 at the closing bell of Thursday’s session. During June, the Tadawul All Share Index suffered its worst decline in six months to reach 11,299. This was led by a 5.43 percent fall in oil giant Saudi Aramco, and 15.47 percent decrease in the Kingdom’s largest valued bank, Al Rajhi. Saudi Industrial Export Co. topped the fallers list despite being the top gainer last month, down 63.87 percent. Also adding to this was a weak performance from all listed sectors as they ended June in the red. Another factor contributing to the performance was the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, which sent oil prices on a rollercoaster, creating instability and shaking the market. It would be pertinent to mention that despite global economic shocks, TASI managed to cross 13,000 points for the first time since 2006 in March, and maintained the level during April as it closed at 13,733.
