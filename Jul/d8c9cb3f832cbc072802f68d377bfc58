JEDDAH: Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev arrived in Jeddah on Saturday. He was received at King Abdulaziz International Airport by Makkah Gov. Prince Khaled Al-Faisal, accompanied by Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture Abdul Rahman Al-Fadli. Last month, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan met with his Kazakh counterpart Mukhtar Tileuberdi during an official visit to Nur-Sultan. During the meeting, the two ministers discussed aspects of relations between the two countries and ways of enhancing them in various fields to serve common interests. Earlier, Kazakh Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Berik Aryn highlighted the historical ties between Kazakhstan and the Kingdom, first established on the ancient Silk Road that connected Central Asia and the Gulf region. The route played a crucial role in facilitating economic, cultural, political and spiritual interaction between East and West. He was speaking during an event in which investment opportunities in Kazakhstan’s tourism industry were presented to Saudi businessmen by the Riyadh, Eastern Province and Jeddah chambers of commerce. Aryn called on participants to restore close cooperation between Kazakhstan and the Kingdom by conducting a joint campaign to promote the two countries as new tourist destinations.
