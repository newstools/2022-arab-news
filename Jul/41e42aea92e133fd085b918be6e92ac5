RIYADH: Saudi deputy minister for protocol affairs and ambassador, Khalid bin Faisal Al-Sehli, on Thursday received Ghana’s envoy to the Kingdom, Mohammed Habibu Tijani. During their meeting in Riyadh — that followed Al-Sehli’s earlier talks with the ambassadors to Saudi Arabia of the Ivory Coast and Turkey, Coulibaly Drissa and Fatih Ulusoy, respectively — they discussed diplomatic relations between the two countries and issues of mutual interest. In June, the deputy minister met with Azerbaijan’s envoy to the Kingdom, Shahin Abdullayev. Al-Sehli has held various positions in Saudi embassies around the world, including Ashgabat in Turkmenistan, Ottawa in Canada, Bangkok in Thailand, and Kuwait.
