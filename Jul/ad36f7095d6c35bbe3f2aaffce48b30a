RIYADH: Saudi Arabia is set to double the capacity amount in renewables tenders this year and in 2023 in preparation for the Middle East’s faster growth in mostly solar and wind projects. This happens as the Kingdom, alongside other crude producers, boosts oil production for export as European countries seek an alternative to Russian fuels. This could be an incentive to get Saudi Arabia to accelerate renewable installations, said Miguel Brito, low carbon electricity analyst at Platts Analytics. Through a micro lens Dubai Electricity and Water Authority has commissioned 287 of 11,000 volts substations in the emirate during the first half of 2022, it said in a statement. Located primarily in Al-Merkad, Jabal Ali First, Saih Shuaib 2, Al-Jadaf and Burj Khalifa areas, the stations come as part of DEWA’s efforts to provide infrastructure according to the highest international standards. GS Inima has reached a $138 million financial closure for Oman desalination plant, Trade Arabia reported citing a statement. The Barka V desalination plant, being developed by Oman Power and Water Procurement, is located 58 kilometers west of the capital Muscat, has a total capacity of 100,000 cubic meters per day.
