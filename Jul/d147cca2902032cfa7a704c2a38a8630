MADINAH: The International Exhibition and Museum of the Prophet’s Biography and Islamic Civilization in Madinah opened its doors to receive visitors and pilgrims after they performed this year’s Hajj rituals. Authorities offered pilgrims a chance to tour the various sections and halls of the exhibition, which is located adjacent to the southern squares of the Prophet’s Mosque. The museum, which is open 24 hours a day, presents an introduction to the Prophet Muhammad through displays and interactive screens available in a variety of languages. A special hall includes rare possessions of the Two Holy Mosques and ancient artifacts. An audio translation gives visitors access the exhibition’s content through specially designated devices. Earlier, Madinah Gov. Prince Faisal bin Salman said that the contents of the exhibition and museum represent “a historical legacy from which to spread the correct Prophetic approach to all parts of the world so as to demonstrate the tolerance and moderation of Islam.” Muslim World League Secretary-General Mohammed bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa said that the museum offers an introduction to the Prophet’s life and Islamic civilization, in addition to highlighting the civilizational values in the Constitution of Madinah and the Makkah Document. The museum was launched last year under the supervision of the MWL and is the first in a series of Islamic museums to travel around the world under the organization’s umbrella. The touring exhibition will employ the latest technology and display techniques to document the Prophet’s life and Islamic civilization to Muslim as well as non-Muslim visitors.
