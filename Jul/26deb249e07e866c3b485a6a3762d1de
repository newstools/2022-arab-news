TUNISIA: Tunisia’s President Kais Saied on Wednesday awarded tennis superstar Ons Jabeur the country’s National Order of Merit, to honor her recent sporting achievements. The world number two had returned to home after losing the Wimbledon final to Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan, and was welcomed at the airport by the ministers of youth, sports, women, transport and tourism, as well as the president of the Tunisian Tennis Federation. Jabeur had become the first African and Arab player to reach a Grand Slam final. Saied described her as the ideal “image of Tunisian youth and Tunisian women who have overcome challenges.” Jabeur said at the presidential palace: “I thank the president for receiving me, and this medal will give me more support to deliver better results. We want to give more hope to young people, and to continue with these successes.”
