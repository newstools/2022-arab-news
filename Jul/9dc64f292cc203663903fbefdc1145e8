RIYADH: The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center distributed Eid clothing and the fifth batch of monthly financial aid to Syrian refugees and host communities in Irbid, Jordan, the Saudi Press Agency reported. The financial aid was provided to 56 families, including 40 Syrian families and 16 Jordanian families, totaling 191 beneficiaries, the majority of whom are orphans and widows. The financial aid aims to support the families in meeting their basic needs and bringing them joy during Eid Al-Adha. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 675,433 Syrian refugees are registered in Jordan, with 136,104 of them residing in Irbid. Around 80 percent of Jordan’s Syrian refugees fall below the poverty line, and 60 percent of families are in extreme poverty, UNHCR also said. Meanwhile, Jordan’s economy continues to struggle. According to the World Bank, Jordan’s GDP and employment growth have averaged 2.4 percent per year since 2011, failing to keep pace with its young workforce. Thus, humanitarian aid from the international community is critical to supporting Jordan and its population. KSrelief has agreed to sponsor orphans and their families in Irbid for a whole year, SPA reported. A similar project has also been launched by the center for Syrian and Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.
