LONDON: Following bans across the UK and EU, the Kremlin-backed RT news channel announced its intention to set up its first Africa bureau. RT said in a statement that it is “currently focused on developing our English-language hub in South Africa” and appointed Paula Slier, a South African broadcaster who ran RT’s Jerusalem bureau, to lead the new office. The news comes after months of speculation during which RT was reported to be working on opening an office in Nairobi, Kenya. RT, formerly known as Russia Today, was banned alongside Sputnik, another state broadcaster, by the EU, the UK and Canada shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. The channels were accused of “war propaganda” and spreading disinformation on behalf of the Russian government. Russia has long sought to gain the support of African countries through online campaigns that challenge Western rhetoric that Russia’s invasion is unjustified and is driving up global food and fuel prices.
