RIYADH: Saudi-based Almarai Co. shares rose 0.39 percent during the opening hours of Sunday, hitting SR52 ($14) per share, as of 11:21 a.m. Saudi time. The dairy giant recorded an 8.4 percent increase in profit for the first half of 2022, primarily due to a recovery from pandemic challenges. Almarai’s net profit increased to SR940 million, from SR867 million in the same period last year, according to a bourse statement. The result was driven by a 19 percent revenue growth following the lifting of COVID-19 movement restrictions, new education institutions opening, and an increase in visitor numbers.
