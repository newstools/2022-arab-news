RIYADH: Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, secretary general for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, will join the Atlantic Council as a distinguished fellow in the Global Energy Center. Barkindo will take part in the Atlantic Council after the conclusion of his term at OPEC on July 31, according to a statement. Serving as OPEC’s secretary general for six years, Barkindo has also played a crucial role in enhancing the cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC countries on stabilizing oil markets. The fellowship at the Atlantic Council comes amid an unprecedented rise in energy prices driven by geopolitical tensions, climate change impacts, and volatile markets. “Barkindo brings a deep understanding of geopolitics in a volatile world that will further enhance the Atlantic Council’s approach to shaping solutions to global energy-security challenges,” said Frederick Kempe, president and CEO of the Atlantic Council. The Washington-based center promotes energy security by working alongside governments, industry leaders, civil society, and public stakeholders. Barkindo said: “I look forward to contributing to the organization’s work on a plethora of energy-related issues, at a time when the world’s eyes are focused on both short- and long-term energy market outlooks.”
