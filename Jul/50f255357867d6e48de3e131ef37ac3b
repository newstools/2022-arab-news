CAIRO: Ecuadorian Minister of Foreign Affairs Carlos Holguin received Ashraf Abdel Qader Salama, the Egyptian ambassador to Ecuador, at the end of Salama’s term in the country. Salama expressed his gratitude for the assistance he had received from officials at the ministry of foreign affairs and the government during his stay in Ecuador. He said there were many cooperation opportunities that should be exploited to strengthen relations between the two countries, especially in tourism, health care, trade exchange and the establishment of special economic zones. He called on Ecuador to take advantage of what a free economic zone could provide for the Suez Canal. Salama reviewed the initiative of the Egyptian embassy to make Ecuador a center for Egyptian exports to Latin markets, as well as Ecuador benefiting from Egypt’s capabilities and position to re-export its products to African countries, the EU and the Middle East in light of the Ecuadorian government’s policy of opening Ecuador to the world. Holguin said that his government was working to increase its cooperation with Egypt, especially in Ecuador’s priority areas, such as importing high-quality pharmaceutical products and fertilizers, and benefiting from Egyptian expertise in irrigation. Holguin said that Ecuador was looking forward to participating in CO27, which will be held next November in Sharm El-Sheikh. He expressed his country’s aspiration to intensify bilateral cooperation with Egypt in all fields during the coming period.
