RIYADH: The US announced extending visit visas for Saudi nationals from five to 10 years starting Aug. 1, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported on Saturday. The step comes a day after US President Joe Biden arrived in Saudi Arabia for a two-day official visit as part of his first Mideast tour as president where he met Saudi King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and senior Saudi officials. In a statement quoted in SPA, the US Mission said extending the validity of visit visas aims to facilitate tourism and business between both countries. “Facilitating travel contributes to the prosperity of the economies of the Kingdom and the United States, boosts commercial partnerships and enhances mutual understanding between American and Saudi citizens,” the statement read. The visa extension, the US Mission noted, also compliments the Interview Waiver Program announced earlier this year to exempt Saudi nationals aged 50 years or above from attending personal interviews to renew US tourist visas.
