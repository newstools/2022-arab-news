LONDON: In the latest in its series of in-depth multimedia Minority Reports, Arab News tells the fascinating story of the Druze, one of the most mysterious and misunderstood faiths of the Middle East.  Rooted in Islam but drawing inspiration from numerous sources, including the Qur’an, the faith took root in Cairo in the early 11th century, during the reign of the sixth Ismaili Shiite Fatimid caliph, Al-Hakim bin Amr. Its followers called themselves the Muwahhidun, or Ahl Al-Tawhid, meaning monotheists or unitarians.

At first, the faith was open to newcomers, its followers preaching freely and openly seeking converts. But with the mysterious disappearance of Al-Hakim in 1021, the Fatimid caliphate turned against the Druze, who were forced underground and scattered across the region. In 1043, facing widespread persecution, the Druze closed their ranks to outsiders forever, abandoning proselytization and instead embracing secrecy for the sake of survival.  This secrecy is maintained to this day, even among the faithful, the majority of whom are denied access to the innermost scriptures and practices of the faith.
