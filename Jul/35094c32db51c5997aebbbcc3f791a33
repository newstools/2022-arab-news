RIYADH: Saudi Arabia condemned on Thursday an attack in Iraq’s Dohuk province that killed eight and wounded 23, Saudi Press Agency reported. The Kingdom affirmed its full support for the government of Iraq in facing the challenges that threaten its security, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Turkey on Wednesday rejected claims by Iraqi officials and state media that it had carried out the attack on a mountain resort in the northern province. Iraq summoned Ankara’s ambassador to Baghdad over the attack and its state agency said the government will call back its charge d'affaires in Ankara. Turkey regularly carries out air strikes in northern Iraq and has sent commandos to support its offensives as part of a long-running campaign in Iraq and Syria against militants of the Kurdish PKK and the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia. Ankara regards both as terrorist groups.
