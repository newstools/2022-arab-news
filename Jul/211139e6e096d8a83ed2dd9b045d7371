RIYADH: Shares of Saudi National Bank, the Kingdom’s largest lender, gained in early Wednesday trading after posting a profit surge to SR9 billion ($2.4 billion) for the first half of 2022. The Saudi-listed bank’s profit leaped 59 percent from SR5.7 billion in the corresponding period last year, a bourse filing showed. In response to the results, shares were up almost 0.9 percent to SR70 by 11:00 a.m. Saudi time, amid trading of almost 800,000 shares. The profit hike came as total operating profit surged 24 percent to SR16.4 billion from SR13.3 billion during the same period a year ago. SNB also attributed the strong figures to a drop in expenses of 12.5 percent, mainly due to lower impairment charges for credit losses.
