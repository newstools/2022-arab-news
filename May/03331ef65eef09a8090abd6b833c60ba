RIYADH: Egyptian defender Ahmed Hegazi has stepped up his fitness comeback in an effort to take part in the highly anticipated Saudi Classico against Al-Hilal on Sunday, the Arabic language daily Arriyadiyah has reported. The Jeddah club currently lead the Saudi Pro League by nine points over reigning champions Al-Hilal, who could cut that lead to six with a win over Al-Ettifaq on Wednesday night. With four matches left for both clubs going into their weekend clash, it would just about keep the title race alive. Sources close to the club told Arriyadiyah that Hegazi, who has been out of action since getting injured at the Africa Cup of Nations in January, was continuing his intensive solitary fitness program, and hoped to get back to full group training this week. His return would be a major boost for Al-Ittihad, who while maintaining a healthy lead in the SPL table, have in recent weeks been showing defensive weaknesses, particularly in the dramatic 4-4 draw against Al-Fateh on Friday.
