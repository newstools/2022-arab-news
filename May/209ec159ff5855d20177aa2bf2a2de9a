People immediately took to TikTok and Twitter to poke fun at the premier’s announcement, while others called for him to quit.         One TikTok user said: “Boris, can you do a hairstyle tutorial please?” Another said: “Country going into recession, so the government made a TikTok to help us.” And another said: “Cheers, Boris, nan’s doing cartwheels to keep warm.” One user even took the prime minister’s refusal to dance as a challenge, putting together a video showing Johnson dancing while holding a beer. On Twitter, one user said, “Boris Johnson isn’t going to last two minutes on TikTok,” while another wrote, “can Boris Johnson get off TikTok please?”  can boris johnson get off tiktok pls — evan (@fourdoubloons) May 11, 2022   Boris Johnson isn't going to last two minutes on TikTok https://t.co/tRViEQfaxv — Hannah (@orangarnold) May 11, 2022
