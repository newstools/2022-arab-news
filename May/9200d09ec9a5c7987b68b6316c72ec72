RIYADH: With the winds of positive change sweeping the UAE, the Emirates is now emphasizing moving from a resource-based economy to a knowledge-based one and leading the advocacy in the region is its emerging creative industry. Michael Garin, director-general at Abu Dhabi Creative Media Authority, a pioneer in the creative industry, told Arab News at the Top CEO event in Dubai that sectors such as gaming also have a massive role in that transition. Garin disclosed that what they have accomplished in 15 years in the film and television industry was achieved in almost two years in the esports and gaming industry. “Already, the revenues generated by gaming far exceed all the advertising revenues in the television business around the world,” he added. Garin believes an economy’s change is through training people for jobs that are still not widely available, and the gaming industry can create an unlimited number of jobs. “The creative industries will drive a great deal of that transition because it’s attracting the smartest, the most talented and the best-educated young people,” he explained.   Explaining the wide reach of its creative industries, Garin shared the success story of Unity Technologies, one of the leading global technology companies in the gaming industry, based in Abu Dhabi. “You turn on your computer; it’s powered by Apple or Microsoft. You make a phone call; it’s an Android phone or an iOS device, but over 94 percent of all games, virtual and augmented reality, are powered by Unity Technologies,” he added. Since its launch last year, the Creative Media Authority has been creating an overarching ecosystem to enable creative individuals and businesses to express themselves and reach new levels of commercial success. The establishment of the authority is part of a 30 billion UAE dirhams ($8.17 billion), 10-year investment strategy across Abu Dhabi by both the public and private sectors to develop the emirate’s culture and creative infrastructure.
