RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Tabuk Cement Co. slipped into losses of SR7 million ($2 million) in its first-quarter earnings after sales dropped 19 percent. The cement producer turned into losses from a profit of SR10 million in the same period of last year, according to bourse filling. The results were primarily impacted by a decrease in average selling price and an increase in the cost of revenues resulting from the periodic maintenance of the plant.
