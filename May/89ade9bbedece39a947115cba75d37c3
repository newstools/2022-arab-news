Some of WWE’s top superstars are gearing up for this year’s Hell in a Cell on Sunday, June 5. In the headline match, Cody Rhodes will face off with Seth Rollins once again as he continues his comeback to WWE. Following their encounters at WrestleMania and WrestleMania Backlash, Rhodes will look to maintain his dominant streak over Rollins inside the cage to move closer to his desired title match for the United States Championship. Only two months after claiming her first Raw Women’s Championship at WrestleMania 38, Bianca Belair will battle it out with previous champions Asuka and Becky Lynch in a Triple Threat match to defend her title and extend her reign on the red brand. In the latest showdown in an ongoing saga, Bobby Lashley will take on Omos and his former manager, MVP, in a Handicap match as a rematch of their WrestleMania 38 contest. Despite the two-to-one disadvantage in the ring this weekend, Lashley aims to take down the Nigerian Giant and the treacherous MVP. Elsewhere, the up-and-coming Superstar Ezekiel will go head-to-head with Kevin Owens after their recent arguments on the “Kevin Owens Show.” Meanwhile, Mustafa Ali will finally get his chance at a one-on-one match against Austin Theory in his quest to snatch the US Championship from his opponent. Meanwhile, the combined forces of Finn Balor, AJ Styles and Liv Morgan will take on bitter rivals, the Judgment Day, as they look to take down Edge, Damian Priest and Rhea Ripley.
