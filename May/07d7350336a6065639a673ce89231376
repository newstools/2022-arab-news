RIYADH: The Abu Dhabi National Co. plans to construct a new liquefied natural gas plant that would more than double its export capacity amid a growing demand. To be built at Fujairah, the plant will be able to produce as much as 9.6 million tons a year, Bloomberg reported. Currently, the UAE has three liquefaction plants with a total capacity of 5.8 million tons per annum at Das Island, located inside the Gulf. This comes as the UAE races to expand its exports amid a growing demand following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
