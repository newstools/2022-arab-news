RIYADH: The World Health Organization has renewed the Saudi Food and Drug Authority as a center for international cooperation in medical devices and supplies for four years.
The decision aims to support the authority’s role in building a center covering the eastern Mediterranean and Africa, and promoting the scientific and technical work of the WHO internationally.
The center will assist developing countries in monitoring and regulating medical devices, and benefiting from its expertise in regulatory and supervisory areas.
Ali Al-Dalaan, executive vice president of the medical devices sector at SFDA, said that the decision was made in light of recent Saudi efforts, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also a result of effective Saudi contribution through food and drug specialists hosting educational workshops in Africa.
The move is set to enhance the Kingdom’s position among various global regulatory bodies and add weight to its presidency of the Global Harmonization Working Party. It will also improve the Saudi contribute to international organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization and the International Medical Device Regulators Forum.
