JEDDAH: The Saudi Yoga Committee, in collaboration with the Asian Yoga Therapy Association in Singapore, will convene the first virtual International Yoga Therapy Conference in Saudi Arabia on June 1. The three-day conference will highlight and discuss the therapeutic and scientific aspects of yoga practice on the body and mind. It will bring together experts from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, India, Japan, the US, and Europe to discuss the benefits of yoga for many issues, including mental health, neurological disorders, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, women’s health, and rheumatic disease.   Committee president Nouf Marwaai said: "We are delighted to announce our first virtual International Yoga Therapy Conference from 1-3 June 2022. There would be eminent speakers and dignitaries from around the world gracing this occasion. Through multiple academic plenary sessions and panel discussions spread over three days, the physicians, scientists, and yoga experts (will) present medical and scientific studies and discuss the modalities and the practice of yoga for health and quality of life.” The conference is part of the committee’s participation in the 100-day countdown to the International Day of Yoga 2022 campaign launched by the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, under India’s Ministry of Ayush. Earlier this year on April 1, the committee held a half-day virtual yoga event as part of its commitment to the countdown. This event opened with a message from Marwaai and MDNIY director Ishwar Basavareddi. It was followed by demonstrations of yoga asanas, pranayama, and meditation classes to improve physical, mental, and emotional health. On April 8, during the holy month of Ramadan, there was an interactive scientific virtual lecture about the benefits of practicing yoga during fasting. It was held and presented by Dr. Rasha Al-Raddadi, an endocrinologist and yoga practitioner, with the participation of 100 people.
