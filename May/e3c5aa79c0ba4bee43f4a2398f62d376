ADEN: King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center’s Masam project during the third week of May dismantled 1,339 mines planted by the Houthi militia across Yemen.
It included 65 anti-personnel mines, 577 anti-tank mines, 692 unexploded ordnance and five explosive devices.
Since the beginning of the project, as many as 339,431 mines have been dismantled.
Saudi Arabia, represented by the center, seeks to use the project to clear Yemen of mines planted by the Houthi militia, which have caused deaths and injuries to innocent children, women and the elderly.
The project aims to assist the Yemeni people to effectively address the human tragedy caused by landmines, UXO and IEDs, create resilience within communities and empower them to take long-term responsibility.
Last week, Yemeni Minister of Information Muammar Al-Eryani said that the mines laid by the Houthi militia are preventing millions of people from returning to their homes, villages and farms to lead their normal lives.
