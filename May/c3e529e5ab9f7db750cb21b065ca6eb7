RIYADH: The Saudi Ministry of Transport and Logistics has continued its efforts to improve its position on the Road Quality Index as it hunts for sixth place in the global rankings by 2030.
The ministry is working to enhance the integration of transport patterns and the road network — which extends to nearly 75,000 km — to improve services in cities, regions and governorates, contributing to bridging the long distances between the outskirts of the country.
This will help facilitate commercial and economic movements and attract tourists and pilgrims to the Two Holy Mosques.
The ministry has made remarkable recent leaps in the road quality index, jumping from 37th in the Road Quality Index in 2016 to 30th in 2018.
In 2019, the Kingdom reached 26th in the global rankings, according to a report issued by the World Competitiveness Forum.
