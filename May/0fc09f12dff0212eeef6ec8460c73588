RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Military Industries has announced the establishment of the National Academy of Military Industries to train national cadres to work in the sector. The announcement comes as part of an extension of the military industry sector’s strategy that was approved by the council of ministers in April last year, the governor of GAMI said in a statement. The academy will be the largest supporter of the sector’s strategy that bets on the national human resource, Ahmed Al-Ohali added. The move aims to achieve the sector’s target of localizing 50 percent of government spending on military equipment and services by 2030.
