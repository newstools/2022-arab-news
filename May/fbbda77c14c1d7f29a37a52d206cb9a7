RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Yemen and supervisor of the Saudi Development and Reconstruction Program for Yemen, Mohammed bin Saeed Al-Jaber, met the UK’s ambassador to Yemen, Richard Oppenheim, in Riyadh.
Oppenheim commended the Kingdom’s efforts in Yemen and its support, most recently the announcement to donate $3 billion from the Kingdom and the UAE to support Yemen’s economy, the Saudi Press Agency reported.
He stressed support for Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, headed by Rashad Al-Alimi, and discussed the joint efforts to make the UN-sponsored truce succeed in order to reach a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire in the country and kickstart the political process.
Oppenheim said it was important for the Houthis to open crossing points in Taiz and deposit revenues into Yemen’s central bank to pay civilians’ stipends.
