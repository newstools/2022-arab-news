CAIRO: Border guards in western Egypt thwarted an attempt to smuggle a large amount of weapons, ammunition and drugs. The Defense Ministry said: “This comes as a continuation of the efforts of the border guards in directing fatal strikes against criminal elements and smugglers, and aborting plans and attempts aimed at harming society and Egyptian national security.” According to the Egyptian military, items seized included four-wheel-drive vehicles, rifles, machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, a satellite phone and 1 million narcotic tablets. Legal measures have been taken against the smugglers. The border guards said they are continuing their “intense efforts … to secure Egypt’s borders.”
