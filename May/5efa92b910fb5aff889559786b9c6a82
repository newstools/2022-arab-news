DUBAI: Marvel series “Moon Knight” has just wrapped up its first season with no mention of whether fans can expect more. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle The miniseries is the first Marvel project to have an Arab director. Egyptian filmmaker Mohamed Diab helms the series, which stars US actors Oscar Isaac, Ethan Hawke and Egyptian-Palestinian actress May Calamawy. The series debuted in March earlier this year on Disney+ and will premiere in the region this summer. Diab spoke to Deadline about the possibility of a second season with no official verdict. He said: “We don’t know if there’s a next season. Marvel doesn’t go with a conventional way, so even if they like the character and want to extend the world, it could be Season Two, it could be a standalone film, or he can join another superhero’s journey.” Diab echoed that he is kept in the dark much like everyone else and added: “We never discussed there being a Season Two, but one day there’s going to be an expansion, but I don’t know how it’s going to look like.” For now, there has been no official release or statement by Disney+ or Marvel about a next chapter for the show. “Moon Knight” tells the story of an ex-mercenary named Marc Spector whom the ancient Egyptian deity Khonshu revives after death. The superhero also suffers from dissociative identity disorder. Meanwhile, Diab gave us gripping works like “Cairo 678,” “Clash” and most recently “Amira,” which screened at the Venice Film Festival in 2021, the El Gouna Film Festival and the MedFilm Festival in Rome, where it scooped up multiple prizes.
