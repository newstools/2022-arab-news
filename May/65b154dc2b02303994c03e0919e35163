RIYADH: There were mixed results for the Saudi Arabian women’s and men’s national futsal teams as they both took on hosts Kuwait on day three of the GCC Games. The Saudi women recorded their first win of the tournament by beating the Kuwaitis 2-1 thanks to goals from star player Al-Bandari Mubarak, and Reem Abdullah. The players were visibly delighted with the performance as they put their opening day 4-1 defeat to Bahrain firmly behind them. The men’s team did not fare as well despite a positive start to their match. Goals by Osama Abdullah and Nasser Al-Harthi gave the Saudis a 2-1 half-time lead, but Kuwait came back strongly in the second half to claim a 3-2 win. The Saudi men’s team now has a win and a loss from two matches having kicked off their campaign on Monday with a 3-1 victory over Bahrain thanks to goals from Mohsen Fakihi, Fahad Al-Rudaini, and Moaz Asiri.
