TUNIS: Naif Arab University for Security Sciences is organizing a five-day seminar on how to rehabilitate and develop female workers in prisons and rehabilitation institutions, in cooperation with the Tunisian General Directorate of Prisons and Rehabilitation, on May 30 in Tunisia. The seminar aims to identify the latest methods of administrative and security organization for women’s prisons and reform centers and to introduce the modern skills needed for female workers in prisons to raise their levels of performance. During the event, NAUSS will identify the most prominent challenges in prisons and means to address them, with a focus on the latest rehabilitation and reform programs and reintegration provided to female inmates. The symposium aims to identify the best methods of psychological and social care for released inmates, and to discuss strategies for effective security management in prisons and rehabilitation facilities, as well as reform, rehabilitation and follow-up programs for female inmates. NAUSS is keen, through its research, to promote and develop alternatives to freedom-depriving punishments within criminal legislation and to allow criminal justice agencies to apply them as alternative punishments in addition to working on “humanizing punishment.” The university discussed several master’s and doctoral theses, and issued several refereed scientific studies in that regard.
