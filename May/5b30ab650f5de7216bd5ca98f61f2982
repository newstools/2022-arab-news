ABHA: Soudah Development, a company of the Public Investment Fund, announced that six newborn Nubian ibex have been welcomed after the company launched a repopulation program last December in cooperation with the National Center for Wildlife.
It is part of efforts by the company to maintain the environment and protect the endangered species.
Soudah Development introduced 15 endangered ibex in the Soudah area with the aim of relocating endangered wild animals and protecting the natural environment in the region.
The initiative contributes to supporting the Kingdom’s environmental efforts.
Soudah Development continues its efforts to preserve biodiversity, restore environmental balance and encourage sustainability in Soudah, which is home to several important species, including the ibex.
Located in the Asir region in the southwest of the Kingdom, the juniper-covered mountains of Soudah are home to the highest peak in Saudi Arabia, situated more than 3,000m above sea level.
