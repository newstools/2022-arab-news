LONDON: The best films that are based on true events make you immediately want to find out more about the real-life story behind the movie — but in the case of Netflix’s “Silverton Siege”, doing so only serves to highlight some of the, let’s say, ‘creative’ liberties that have been taken with the truth. So, far better to enjoy this movie simply for what it is: A middling action thriller with some decent performances by a cast of relative unknowns. For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle A trio of freedom fighters — Calvin, Terra and Ando — are on the run after a botched anti-apartheid mission in 1980’s South Africa. Fleeing the authorities, they escape into a bank in Silverton, Pretoria, where a tense standoff with the police sees them demand the release of Nelson Mandela. The aforementioned creative liberties add a few more ‘Hollywood’ moments in for good measure — a botched escape attempt, a hostage with government connections, some wanton destruction — and serve to keep the film moving. Director Mandla Dube shifts from quiet exposition to action with a deft touch, and the three principal actors (Thabo Rametsi, Noxolo Dlamini and Stefan Erasmus, respectively) make for believable young idealists, willing to give their lives for the cause.   The authorities, however, are painted in broad strokes by Dube, and lack any real subtlety. They are only noteworthy, for the most part, for their unapologetic racism. Like most of the rest of “Silverton Siege”, these characters feel more like caricature. It’s all a little overblown: The bad guys sneer, the heroes look intensely into the middle distance. And some of those Hollywood elements feel as contrived as they are fictionalized. But, at the end of the day, this remains a taut, efficient movie. Choose to enjoy it as such — and be prepared to suspend any expectations of learning more about the real events that inspired it — and it makes for a fun way to spend 90 minutes.
