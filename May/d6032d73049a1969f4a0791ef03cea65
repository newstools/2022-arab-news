Saudi cookie connoisseurs will no doubt be familiar with Choowy Goowy, a Riyadh-based dessert house with a name that perfectly sums up the consistency of its products.
Located north of Riyadh at One Square, the restaurant offers a range of classic cookie favorites including chocolate chip, peanut butter, salted caramel, Kinder, and Nutella. Special birthday cake flavored varieties are also available, along with date cookies too.

An alternative to coffee is a glass of milk, perfect for dipping cookies in.
The outlet’s signature offering, the ultimate, comes in an aluminum container filled with cookie and topped with a scoop of Madagascar vanilla bean ice cream, drizzled in a caramel sauce. A choice of either molten milk chocolate, Kinder, or Nutella goes in the center.

For kids, the restaurant sells a DIY baking set that includes 150 grams of cookie dough, toppings of sprinkles, marshmallows, chocolate chips, and M&M’s, and shape cutters.
