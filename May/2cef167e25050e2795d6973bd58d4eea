Saudi Arabia’s annual inflation rate accelerated to reach 2.3 percent in April, up from 2 percent in March, according to the General Authority for Statistics, also known as GASTAT. The consumer price index, or CPI, in April 2022 has surged 2 percent when compared to the corresponding period a year earlier, primarily driven by a rise in food and beverages prices as well as transport. Food and beverages prices increased by 4.3 percent due to an increase in meat prices by 3.5 percent, and vegetable prices by 13.5 percent. Transport prices climbed 4.6 percent due to a rise in gasoline prices by 9.5 percent along with a rise in car prices by around 4.1 percent. Personal goods and services prices increased by 2.8 percent, mainly resulting from an increase in prices of jewelry, clocks and watches.
