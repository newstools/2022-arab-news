More than 65 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered since the Kingdom’s immunization campaign began, with almost 25 million people fully vaccinated. The ministry, which has 587 vaccine centers across the country, urged people who have not yet received a jab to register for a series through the Sehhaty app. Under the slogan “It’s our turn,” the ministry continued calling on parents to register their children between five and 11 for the vaccine, to protect them from variants and possible complications. Meanwhile, testing hubs and treatment centers set up throughout the country have helped millions of people since the outbreak of the pandemic. Taakad centers provide COVID-19 testing for those who show no or mild symptoms or believe they have come into contact with an infected individual, while Tetamman clinics offer treatment and advice to those with virus symptoms such as fever, loss of taste and smell, and breathing difficulties.
