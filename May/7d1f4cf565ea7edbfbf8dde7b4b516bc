RIYADH: Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University has signed an agreement to join the Saudi Unified Catalog of the King Fahd National Library.
This development ensures that intellectual resources can be easily accessed from one database, which will benefit the nation’s researchers.
The agreement was signed by university representative Rabiah Al-Barrak and Othman Mohammed Al-Asmari, director of the catalog project.
The library aims to build a national reference to standardize technical practices. It also seeks to develop information and knowledge projects, and to facilitate coordination between institutions in Saudi Arabia.
In February, the library joined the International Federation of Libraries and Institutions for 2022. The federation consists of 1,600 members from 150 countries around the world.
Dr. Mansour bin Abdullah Al-Zamil, secretary of the KFNL, pointed out that joining the federation is the culmination of the library’s efforts in strengthening international cooperation, which would not have been possible without the continuous support from the Saudi leadership. AN Riyadh
Al-Zamil stressed that by joining the federation, the library will be able to share knowledge, experiences, standards and methods of work and keep pace with global developments, in addition to actively participating in meetings, seminars, workshops and conferences.
