LONDON: The Yemeni government has called on the UN and its special envoy to the country, Hans Grundberg, to take “serious and real” action to end the continuing and escalating Houthi violations of a truce that came into effect on April 2, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Thursday. “The escalation of the blatant Houthi attacks culminated in targeting the Taiz Security Department with drones (on Wednesday), which led to the injury of 10 people, including civilians, material damage and panic among children and families celebrating Eid Al-Fitr in a nearby park,” a government source said, according to a report by Yemeni news agency SABA. The source stressed that the Iranian-backed militia’s repeated violations of the truce represent a real test of how serious the UN and the wider international community are about putting pressure on the Houthi militia to comply with peace efforts. They also said that the continuing terrorist attacks by the militia and its consistent failure to respect the UN-brokered humanitarian truce from the moment it was implemented reflect the actions of the militia and its supporters to undermine all opportunities for peace and efforts to find a political solution to the crisis. The government source also highlighted the need for the siege on Taiz Governorate to end immediately, in accordance with the terms of the truce.
