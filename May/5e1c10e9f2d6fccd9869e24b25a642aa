JEDDAH: With no deaths reported, Saudi Arabia on Tuesday registered 102 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 113 recoveries, according to the Health Ministry’s latest statistics on the illness. Saudi health authorities have so far registered more than 754,340 COVID-19 infections and 9,093 deaths since the pandemic broke out in the country in March 2020, after a citizen arrived from Iran through Bahrain. More than 742,019 of these cases were all confirmed recovered, thanks to the government’s vaccination campaign, which has administered more than 64 million vaccine doses through 587 centers across the Kingdom, providing the free service to citizens and residents alike. Nearly 25 million people have been fully vaccinated. The ministry announced that 3,228 COVID-19 cases were still active, adding that 8,756 PCR tests were done, bringing the total number of tests to almost 42 million. Of the current cases, 52 remain in critical condition. Under the slogan “It’s our turn,” the ministry continued calling on parents to register their children between 5 and 11 for the vaccine to ensure their safety and protect them from variants and any other complications. The ministry urged people who have not yet received their jabs to register to receive them through its Sehhaty app.
