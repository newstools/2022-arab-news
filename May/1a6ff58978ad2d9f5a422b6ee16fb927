RIYADH: After years of hard work, executives finally land a position in the C-suite, but that only calls for even more work, concentration, and energy. With the average age for C-suite positions being above 40, these executives require rejuvenation, and that’s where Aviv Clinics Dubai comes in. In an exclusive interview with Arab News on the sidelines of the Top CEO event in Dubai, Aviv Clinics Dubai CEO Mike Frayne spoke about hyperbaric oxygen therapy for all ages, specifically CEOs. Frayne explained that clients under hyperbaric oxygen therapy are asked to breathe 100 percent oxygen for a specific time in a repeated cycle which increases oxygen in the body by almost 20 times. “That’s beneficial because it gets oxygen to tissue, which otherwise it’s difficult to reach. And as we grow older, the microvessels in our brain and our body become narrowed or occluded. So it becomes more difficult for oxygen to reach the brain and body tissues. So we get more oxygen to the tissue,” he explained. “What that does is it triggers regenerative processes in your body. It triggers stem cells in your body to produce themselves. And we have those in our bone marrow, liver, hippocampus in the brain, and it also triggers blood vessels to grow,” he added. Frayne said this kind of therapy is essential for CEOs or C-suite positions to keep their performance at a high by increasing stamina, cognitive ability, and physical and mental performance. Another benefit highlighted by Frayne is the increase in telomere length in the human DNA, which is known as a biomarker for age longevity. “It ensures that your cells replicate for longer. And we also reduce something called senescence cells. When cells stop replicating, they can become problematic. They can become cancer cells. And we stop that from happening,” he added.
