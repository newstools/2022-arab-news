Moscow: Gazprom said Thursday it would stop sending natural gas via the Polish part of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline following Russia's retaliatory sanctions against Western companies. On Wednesday, Russia announced sanctions on more than 30 energy companies, including Poland's EuRoPol GAZ S.A., the owner of the Polish part of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline. “For Gazprom this means a ban on the use of a gas pipeline owned by EuRoPol GAZ to transport Russian gas through Poland,” Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said in a statement.
