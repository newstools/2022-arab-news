RIYADH: The aviation sector has slowed due to China’s zero-Covid policy, which is impossible to achieve, according to International Air Transport Association director general, Willie Walsh. Walsh made the remarks while speaking at the Future Aviation Forum in Riyadh on May 9. Walsh noted that soaring energy prices are one of the most difficult challenges the aviation sector is facing, as it tries to come out of the economic slump caused by the pandemic — with consumers paying higher ticket prices. The IATA director general revealed that the airline industry is committed to achieving net-zero by 2050, despite the challenges this involves. Sounding a cautionary note, he made it clear that these initiatives would cost a lot of money, and would need greater commitment from the financial community to allocate funding to help achieve this target. While the use of hydrogen as aviation fuel has been much talked about in recent months, Walsh indicated that a complex process was involved to achieve this. He said countries should initially develop aircraft engines that can use this energy source.
