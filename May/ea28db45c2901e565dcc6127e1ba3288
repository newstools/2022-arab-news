DUBAI: The BBC has issued an apology after a message appeared on the news channel’s ticker that read “Manchester United are rubbish.”   The text appeared at the bottom of the screen during a tennis update on Tuesday morning. Later the same day, BBC News presenter Annita McVeigh apologized for the error. “I hope that Manchester United fans weren’t offended by it,” McVeigh said. She explained that the error occurred because someone behind the scenes was learning how to use the ticker. “They were just writing random things, not in earnest,” she added. That does appear to be the case as the ticker also featured the text “Weather rain everywhere.” The incident and the apology have gone viral on social media, with many users commenting on how the BBC only apologized to the fans and not to the club itself.
