Well-known Lebanese journalist and writer Rajeh Khoury died Friday after struggling to battle with illness, Lebanese and regional media reported. The late journalist was “one of the distinguished, authentic writers from a generation of great men… who dedicated life and sacrifices for the sake of free speech, truth, and courage that knows no retreat or fear,” An-Nahar announced, one of the press institutions that the late journalist worked for. An-Nahar lost one of its “pillars and senior writers in the dark nights of Lebanon,” it added. Khoury, originally from South Lebanon, wrote and contributed wide-ranging content from articles to political analyses for outfits including Al-Aamal, Al-Hawadeth magazine, Al-Hayat, Nidaa Al-Watan, An-Nahar and Asharq Al-Awsat.
