RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s King Salman congratulated the UK’s Queen Elizabeth on her 70-year reign, the Saudi Press Agency reported early Monday. In a cable, the king wished Queen Elizabeth constant health and happiness and the people of the United Kingdom further progress and prosperity. Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman also sent a similar cable. Queen Elizabeth, 96, marked seven decades as queen in February, and nationwide events to commemorate her Platinum Jubilee, including a thanksgiving service and a music concert outside Buckingham Palace, will take place from June 2 to 5. Elizabeth became the queen of the United Kingdom and more than a dozen other realms including Canada, Australia and New Zealand on the death of her father King George VI on Feb. 6, 1952, while she was in Kenya on an international tour. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other British political leaders paid tribute to "remarkable" Queen Elizabeth on Thursday ahead of four days of celebrations next week to honor her 70 years on the throne. The four days of celebrations begin next Thursday with the traditional ‘Trooping the Colour’ military parade in central London, and will also include a service at London’s St. Paul’s Cathedral on Friday, a concert outside Buckingham Palace the next day, and a pageant through the British capital on Sunday.
