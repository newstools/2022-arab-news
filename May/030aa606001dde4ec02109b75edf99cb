RIYADH: In a bid to smooth the process of international air travel, Saudi Arabia has announced a new Global Air Travel policy at the inaugural Future Aviation Forum in Riyadh on May 9. The General Authority of Civil Aviation developed the tentatively named Harmonizing Air Travel policy in cooperation with the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization. The new framework is expected to make international journeys simpler, by avoiding the confusion over travel requirements currently discouraging millions of people from booking flights. “Aviation is the lifeblood of the global economy, and it is crucial to safeguard it from future disruption,” said GACA president Abdulaziz bin Abdullah Al-Duailej, adding: “The Harmonizing Air Travel policy framework demonstrates the leadership role Saudi Arabia is taking to ensure that the sector thrives in the years to come.” The new policy will be formally presented at the 41st ICAO General Assembly later in 2022 to receive approval from member states. A recent study by YouGov has found that uncertainty over health requirements is discouraging a significant number of people from traveling abroad.
