RIYADH: The Coalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen on Friday said Houthi allegations of deaths in the Al-Raqu border region by Saudi forces “are untrue”. In a statement, the coalition said the victims are migrants who were “killed in forced displacement and armed clashes launched by the Houthis.” “The brutal Houthi operation came after disputes and the burning of the homes of immigrants,” said the statement carried by state media. It said the killing of migrants is “a repeat of the Houthi burning of hundreds of African migrants in Sanaa.” The coalition called on the United Nations “to assume its responsibility in exposing the brutal Houthi violations” against migrants. _____________ ALSO READ: Exclusive: Ethiopian survivors retell horrors of last month’s ‘Houthi holocaust’
