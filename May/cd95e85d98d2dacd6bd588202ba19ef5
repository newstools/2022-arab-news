The Kingdom’s National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking (NCCT) held a meeting with several technology experts from groups related to supporting victims of trafficking to review its electronic systems as part of its digital transformation strategy. The meeting focused on the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), with the chairman of the committee — represented by Vice Chairman Sarah Al-Tamimi — emphasizing the importance of completing the digitized system. Al-Tamimi said that the meeting reviewed the opinions of the relevant parties and to finalize all technical requirements with the tech company and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. She added that this would allow for the launching of training programs for human trafficking specialists in the relevant authorities. The NRM connects relevant government agencies to facilitate the documenting and tracking processes and submit statistical reports, which consist of five stages: Identification, rescue and shelter, investigation and prosecution, protection and assistance and voluntary return.
