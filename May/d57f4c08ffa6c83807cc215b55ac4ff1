RIYADH: Low-carbon fuel could help the aviation sector transition to greener forms of energy, Saudi Arabia's energy minister claimed while speaking at the Future Aviation Forum in Riyadh. Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman made the remarks as he highlighted the importance of going green and sustainability to the sector. The minister noted that achieving sustainability cannot be done by just relying on biofuels, and all options — including hydrogen —should be considered to ensure a better low-carbon future. “You can’t make a conclusion by saying 'I will do this and that'. You have got quite a few choices, you have got to look at all those choices including working hard on land and aviation operations," he said adding: “You could use electric cars and even greening airports by itself, every component you could enhance in this holistic approach, the circular carbon economy approach can help." The circular carbon approach is the process by which carbon dioxide is captured from hydrocarbon production, coal, and natural gas power plants. The prince added that synthetic fuel will be produced from the collected carbon dioxide. He also noted that the gap between crude oil prices and prices for jet fuel, diesel and gasoline is down to the lack of refining capacity.
