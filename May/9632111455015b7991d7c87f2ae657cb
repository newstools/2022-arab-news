RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan met with his Thai counterpart Don Pramudwinai in Riyadh on Monday. During the meeting, the two officials reviewed bilateral relations between the two countries and ways to enhance, develop, and advance them in various fields. They also exchanged views on regional and international issues of common interest. Ties between the Kingdom and Thailand were renewed in January, following Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha’s visit to Riyadh on the invitation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The visit was the first top leadership meeting between the countries in more than three decades after relations were downgraded in the 1980s.
