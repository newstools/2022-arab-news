LONDON: CNN Arabic’s Her Story initiative launched its second podcast training session on Wednesday aimed at female journalists and content creators from Arab countries. Training was conducted virtually by Samya Ayish, CNN Arabic journalist, producer and editor of Her Story, in partnership with the Arab Network for Science and Journalism. Different types of audio content, script writing, recording, montage and publishing were covered in the program, which focused on podcasting. The training session, attended by 40 Arab female journalists from the region, began with a brief speech by Caroline Faraj, vice president and editor-in-chief of CNN Arabic, followed by a speech from Ahmed Al-Shamir, president of the Arab Network for Scientific Journalism. Following the session, participants were able to pitch proposals and ideas for possible stories, with the winning ideas to be commissioned and published on the CNN Arabic Her Story page. Her Story, or Hikayatoha in Arabic, is a multi-platform editorial and training initiative that profiles Arab women creating an impact in their local communities. The initiative was launched on March 8, International Women’s Day, to offer Arab women a high-profile platform to share their untold stories, and voice their thoughts and opinions. In addition to the editorial feature, CNN Arabic also launched the first edition of a special training program for young women starting careers in journalism, content production and storytelling.
