RIYADH: Saudi Arabia participated in celebrating the International Day for Women in Maritime, which falls on May 18 and was approved by the International Maritime Organization in 2021 as an annual occasion. The day highlights women’s achievements in the maritime sector, the importance of their participation in the national economy and social and economic development, and their main contributions to the Kingdom’s Vision 2030. It also aims to strengthen their role in the maritime sector. On this day, the Transport General Authority, based on its legislative role in the maritime sector, conducted a number of activities and events focusing on the importance of women’s role in the field. The Transport General Authority recently implemented a social initiative for primary school girls with the aim of raising awareness about the sector. The initiative comes as an extension of the objective to highlight the vital role of women in all fields, particularly in transport and logistics, and the authority’s efforts to provide opportunities for women in these fields.
