RIYADH: Following their successful green hydrogen project in NEOM, ACWA Power is partnering again with US-based Air Products to develop a multibillion-dollar world-scale green hydrogen-based ammonia production plant in Oman with the sultanate's energy company OQ. Powered by renewable energy, the facility will produce green energy products, according to a statement. The statement did not mention the exact value of the project. The green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility is anticipated to be equally owned by the project partners. “Our investment in developing and building water desalination and power production plants in Oman started in 2011, and we continue to expand our robust portfolio in the Sultanate,” ACWA Power chairman said. “Utilizing our global expertise, we were successfully able to launch Oman’s first utility-scale renewable energy project,” Mohammad A. Abunayyan added.
