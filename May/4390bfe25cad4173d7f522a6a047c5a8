RIYADH: The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center held on the occasion of Eid Al-Fitr a reception for its employees at its Riyadh headquarters in the presence of the center’s general supervisor Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah and center officials.
Al-Rabeeah congratulated the center’s employees and thanked them for all the effort they were exerting and the work they were doing to implement KSrelief initiatives that had turned the center into an icon of the humanitarian field.
“KSrelief was able to reach more than 80 nations across the world and become a global role model when it comes to humanitarian work,” he stressed.
Al-Rabeeah also highlighted the importance of “striving to develop humanitarian work and introduce new initiatives and ideas in this field, particularly in light of the growing humanitarian needs, due to which humanitarian organizations, especially KSrelief, are having to multiply their efforts and assume additional responsibilities.”
