LONDON: Newcastle United’s away kit for next season could be adorned with the green and white colors of Saudi Arabia, in a nod to the Kingdom’s Public Investment Fund majority ownership of the club. The potential new second kit, made by British sportswear brand Castore, was leaked online, revealing a design that bears many similarities to the one worn by the Saudi Arabian national side in 2020. The white shirt is bordered by a green trim around the neck and the sleeves. United’s iconic club crest and the Castore logo are both in light green. The new shirt has not been confirmed by the club, but Magpies fans have flocked to social media to share their positive views on the new top. Steve Wraith, a British actor, tweeted a photo of the rumored new strip: “I will take 7. 1 for each day of the week.” @InnTooned said: “Well I wouldn’t normally buy the away top, however given the amount of venom aimed at us, I’ll be getting one this season!” Another Newcastle fan on Twitter, Jimmy, said it would be the first shirt he’d purchased since 2002. While the 2022 update gives a nod to the club’s ownership, a green and white strip is nothing new to United. The team wore the same color pattern in the 1999-2000 season.
