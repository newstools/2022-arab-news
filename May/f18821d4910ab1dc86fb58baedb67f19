RIYADH: Saudi Arabia's NEOM Green Hydrogen Co. is understood to have selected India's Larsen & Toubro to build solar and wind plants for supplying electricity to the city’s $6.4-billion green hydrogen-based ammonia plant, MEED reported. ACWA Power, one of the three equity partners in NGHC along with Air Products and NEOM Co., is responsible for supplying the energy to the project. The Riyadh-based firm declined to comment on the news when contacted by Arab News. According to MEED, L&T, along with Energy China and Power China, submitted a proposal for an engineering, procurement and construction contract to build the renewable energy infrastructure. The contract covers the construction of 2,930 MW solar power generation plant, a 1,370 MW wind power farm and a 400 MW battery energy storage system, according to a source familiar with the plan. The package also includes a 190-kilometer power transmission network. The planned wind and solar power plants are to be located in northwest Saudi Arabia in proximity to the hydrogen plant, which is to be built at OXAGON industrial zone in NEOM.
