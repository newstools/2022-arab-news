MADINAH: Al-Ghamama Mosque, located 500 meters southwest of the Prophet’s Mosque, is one of Madinah’s most prominent historical sites. It has been associated with the journey of Prophet Muhammad and is known as the last place where he performed Eid and rain prayers. The mosque has undergone repair and restoration work several times since it was built during the era of Umar bin Abdulaziz, between the year 86 A.H. and 93 A.H. Sultan Hassan bin Muhammad bin Qalawun Al-Salihi renewed it before the year 761 A.H. and it was restored again during the reign of Sultan Inal in 861 A.H. Al-Ghamama Mosque has also been taken care of and renovated during the era of King Salman, who showed great interest and care for its architectural style, to have people benefit from performing prayers in it and embracing many religious and cultural activities, and enhance its historical value related to the prophet’s journey. The mosque is covered from the outside with black basalt stones, and its domes and interior walls are painted white, while the arches are shaded in black to complete the mosque's beautiful appearance. A delightful green panel is placed at the entrance to the building upon which the words Al-Ghamama Mosque are written in beautiful calligraphy. The mosque’s external arches are a rare architectural masterpiece, built with dark-colored stones and separated by white lines. Inside, the beautiful arches suggest the splendor of the engineering art that designed them and the craftsmanship that executed them.
