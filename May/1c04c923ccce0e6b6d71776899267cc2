JEDDAH: More than 200,000 people attended Jeddah Season during the first three days of this year’s extravaganza, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Wednesday. Visitors flocked to the exciting events and shows that began at the Jeddah Art Promenade and Cirque du Soleil zones on Monday, the first day of the Eid Al-Fitr holiday that marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. A variety of shows along the promenade, including live performances, attracted large crowds. Visitors also enjoyed the fireworks displays that will take place there daily throughout the 60-day Jeddah Season. “The integration of services and the diversity of offers also contributed to the increase in the demand that Jeddah Art witnessed over the past days, which is expected to attract more visitors throughout the season,” SPA said. Attractions in the Cirque du Soleil area include international acts performing shows that include acrobatic displays, juggling, helium balloons, swings and more. Organizers reported remarkable levels of attendance and interaction. The numbers of visitors, from inside and outside the Kingdom, are expected to further increase in the coming days and weeks as more Jeddah Season events and activities are launched in other event zones, catering to all interests, tastes and age groups. Jeddah Season, which returns this year for its second edition following a two-year hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, continues throughout May and June. It includes a packed schedule of more than 2,800 events taking place across nine specially designated zones.
