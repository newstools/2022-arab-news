Al-Otaibi is hosting a solo show, titled “Soft Whispers,” that features new works from her painting series “Softboi.”  A post shared by Hawazin هوازن (@hawazin.o) Her colorful imagery plays with ironic, non-conforming representations of masculinity in the Arab world. The painter draws her references from early childhood memories of Saudi cultural and religious books on femininity, as well as the symbolism associated with female purity, beauty, chastity and vulnerability.

Besides Al-Otaibi, London Gallery Weekend presents work from artists from across the region Middle East and North Africa, including Nour Jaouda from Libya, Nour El-Saleh from Lebanon, Rachid Koraïchi from Algeria, Laila Tara from Iran and Ghada Amer and Iman Issa from Egypt.
