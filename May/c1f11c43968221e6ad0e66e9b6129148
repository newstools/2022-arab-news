RIYADH: Nearly 1,000 mines planted by the Houthi militia in Yemen have been cleared by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSrelief) de-mining project Masam so far in May, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported Sunday. Of the 998 explosive devices the de-mining team removed, 677 were anti-tank devices and 321 were unexploded ordnance. Since the launch of the Masam project, as many as 336,891 mines have been dismantled across Yemen. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, represented by KSrelief, seeks through the project to clear Yemeni lands of the mines that were randomly planted by the Houthi militia causing death and injury of innocent children, women, and the elderly, SPA said.
