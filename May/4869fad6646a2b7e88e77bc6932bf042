RIYADH: The Royal Moroccan Football Federation on Monday denied rumors that national team coach Vahid Halilhodzic had been dismissed from his post, confirming in a tweet that the Bosnian was out of the country on holiday. The statement came in response to reports circulating on some online platforms and news outlets that claimed that a decision to dismiss the 69-year-old had been taken by the federation earlier in the day. It said: “No meeting took place today between the president of the federation and the national coach, the latter who is still on a special holiday outside Morocco and will join the Mohammed VI Football Academy this week, as previously announced.”
