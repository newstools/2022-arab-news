NEWCASTLE: Newcastle United defender Paul Dummett has signed a one-year extension at St. James’ Park and says he is looking forward to a “big season” on Tyneside. Dummett’s previous deal was due to run out in June and the 30-year-old Geordie, who came through the club’s academy, was set to leave on a free. However, Newcastle have reached an agreement with the left-back that will see him remain part of the club’s 25-man Premier League squad for 2022-23. “This is a hugely exciting time for the football club and the city, so I’m delighted to be committing another year here and staying at my boyhood club,” said Dummett on the confirmation. “I’m immensely proud that next season will be my 10th with the first team and I’m really looking forward to being part of what is a big season to come. Howay the lads.” Newcastle-born Dummett made his Magpies’ debut in January 2013 and has since made more than 200 appearances for the club. He has also spent time out on loan at National League Gateshead and Scottish Premiership outfit St. Mirren, and been capped four times by Wales. Head Coach Eddie Howe said that Dummett epitomises the type of player he wants to keep at the club. “Paul is a consummate professional who has given so much to this club and I’m delighted he will be staying with us,” Howe said. “He is a player and a person I like very much. He leads by example both in the dressing room and on the pitch, and I’m pleased to retain someone with his positive influence and defensive capabilities.” Newcastle remain in talks with fellow homegrown talent Sean Longstaff whose deal also ends in June. The midfielder has established himself as a key first-team player under Howe after having looked set for an exit while previous manager Steve Bruce was at the club. Longstaff is believed to have been offered a new four-year deal, and hopes are high that he will follow Dummett and Fabian Schar in agreeing to extended deals. Last week Schar signed a new two-year deal.
