Blue Tok Tok is an Indian fast-food restaurant in Riyadh that captures the essence of the South Asian country’s authentic tastes and flavors in very sizable portions.
Located in Al-Nakheel district, the eatery is named after the three-wheeled auto rickshaws used for urban transport in India.
Indian food is in some ways similar to Arabic cuisine in being heavily dependent on fragrant rice and bread, and Blue Tok Tok offers colorful biryani and saffron rice made with aromatic spices, as well as fresh naan bread straight from the oven, items that have earned it rave reviews online.
The restaurant’s large but reasonably priced dishes include main courses such as chicken biryani for two to three people costing SR36 ($9.60), and lamb masala, garlic naan, and samosa at SR29 per person.
Chicken tikka, puri, tandoori, tikka masala, and butter are among the white meat options.
Most of the food is relatively mild to taste but customers can request extra spices. Dips are also available, and the tamarind chutney is recommended.
As well as restaurant dining, home delivery orders can be made via apps such as HungerStation, Jahez, and Lugmety.
