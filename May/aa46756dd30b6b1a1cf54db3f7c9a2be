RIYADH: The president of Yemen’s leadership council said that his government is respecting the cease-fire in the country despite the Houthi militia’s disregard for it. Rashad Al-Alimi said: “We confirm our adherence to the truce, despite all Houthi militia’s violations.” He said his council will preserve the consensus and the partnership to help the country. Al-Alimi also thanked Saudi Arabia and the UAE for their support for the Yemeni people. The two-month truce, which began at the start of Ramadan, has been repeatedly violated by the Iran-back militia, particularly in Marib where they are using the halt in fighting to gain a strategic military advantage as they aim to take the resource-rich province from government control.
