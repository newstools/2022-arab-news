Tech giant Apple Inc. has sued “stealth-mode” startup Rivos Inc. for allegedly targeting and luring its engineers to steal trade secrets used to develop its homegrown chip designs that make iPhones more efficient and powerful, a Bloomberg report stated. In the lawsuit filed in federal court in San Jose, California, Apple claimed that several of its engineers joined Rivos after stealing sensitive trade-secret information related to “system-on-chip” designs, including its M1 laptop and A15 mobile phone chips. Apple also claimed that it has devoted billions of dollars to this critical work. The company also alleged that these former employees transferred gigabytes of trade secret data, including presentations on current and unreleased chip designs to their personal storage devices as they left the company.
