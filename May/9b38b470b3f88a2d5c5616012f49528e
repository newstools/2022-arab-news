JEDDAH: Jeddah Season 2022 has attracted more than 2 million visitors within its first month. The season returned after a two-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced Saudi Arabia to suspend public events in the interests of public safety. The 60-day season, which kicked off on May 2, has seen crowds flock to enjoy the daily international musical and cultural performances. More than 200,000 people headed to the event in its first three days. The season has also appealed to the city’s expat families, the majority of whom are from Pakistan, India, the Philippines, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. They have been keen to attend the varied musical and entertainment shows, some of which were especially created for the Jeddah Season. Abdullah Al-Dousi, a Jeddah-based librarian, said that it is not a surprise that the Jeddah Season has hit record numbers. “The big number confirms the historical, cultural and recreational features of the coastal city. It also stresses the high position of the Bride of the Red Sea (Jeddah) on the regional tourist map,” he said. Jeddah Season is made up of nine zones designated to host various activities. These zones are: the Jeddah Yacht Club, Jeddah Art Promenade, Jeddah’s Superdome, Al-Jawhara Stadium, Jeddah Pier, Prince Majed Park, City Walk, Al-Balad and Jeddah Jungle. The Jeddah Season came nearly a month after the resounding success of the five-month Riyadh Season, which recorded 15 million visits to recreational activities that held the attention and interest of Riyadh residents and tourists from around the world.
