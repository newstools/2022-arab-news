NEW YORK: Charge d’affaires of Saudi Arabia’s permanent mission to the UN, Mohammed Al-Ateeq, participated in the virtual symposium held by the National Center for Vegetation Cover and Combating Desertification on the sidelines of the UN Forum on Forests. Al-Ateeq stressed Saudi Arabia has taken the lead in facing the challenges of climate change and desertification, especially in light of unprecedented issues posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that the Kingdom has made serious commitments and sought to overcome the consequences of the pandemic without compromising the gains of sustainable development. “Saudi Arabia has launched two main sustainability initiatives, namely Saudi Green Initiative and Middle East Green Initiative, as they provide a model for inclusiveness and aim to meet sustainability goals with a focus on recycling, specifically through the framework of the circular carbon economy,” he said. Al-Ateeq underlined the pioneering efforts of the National Center for Vegetation Cover and Combating Desertification in the Kingdom in addressing the effects of climate change through innovative mechanisms and solutions, as well as sustainability initiatives, expressing his desire to discuss afforestation efforts in the Kingdom at the UN Forum on Forests. This symposium, organized by the center, aims to shed light on the role of the SGI, planting trees, and preserving natural resources in combating climate change, ensuring sustainable development and improving human well-being.
