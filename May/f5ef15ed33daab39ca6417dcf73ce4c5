RIYADH: Iraq said it will start implementing a court ruling that gives the federal authorities oversight of Kurdish production after failed talks with officials from the semi-autonomous region, Bloomberg reported on Sunday. The Iraqi Oil Ministry did not reach an agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government over oil output and exports after 75 days of talks, Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar said during a round-table meeting with officials in the Iraqi National Oil Co. Baghdad’s central government has long asserted its right to manage resources in Kurdistan, which has been pumping and selling oil independently. The top court ruled in February that the Oil Ministry is the sole body in charge of all oil operations in the country. “We are moving to implement the provisions of this ruling. It is not easy,” the minister said.
