RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Sport Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal on Friday concluded his official visit to the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, to attend the 77th meeting of the Executive Office of the Olympic Council of Asia.
Prince Abdulaziz, who is also president of the Saudi Olympic and Paralympic Committee and vice president of the Olympic Council of Asia, attended the meeting, which was chaired by Acting President of Olympic Council of Asia Randhir Singh, in the presence of Prince Fahd bin Jalawi bin Abdulaziz bin Musaed, vice chairman of the committee, member of the Executive Office and chairman of the council’s Education Committee.
The meeting adopted the decision to postpone the date of the Hangzhou 2022 Asian Games, which was scheduled to be held in China in September, to next year, due to developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic in that country, which may hinder the participation of many athletes in the tournament.
The meeting also agreed to cancel this year’s edition of the Asian Youth Games, which was scheduled to be held in Shantou, China.
On the sidelines of his visit to Tashkent, Prince Abdulaziz signed a memorandum of understanding between the committee and its Olympic and Paralympic counterparts in Uzbekistan to enhance cooperation and joint coordination in the field between the two countries.
He also attended an official celebration, which was held by the Uzbek Olympic Committee to mark the 30th anniversary of the committee’s founding, in the presence of a number of Uzbek officials and sports figures.
