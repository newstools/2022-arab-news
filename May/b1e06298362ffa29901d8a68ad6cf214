RIYADH: Saudi authorities on Wednesday thwarted an attempt to smuggle more than 11 million amphetamine tablets and nearly 25 kilograms of hashish into the country. A total of 11,256,691 highly addictive and illegal amphetamine pills and 24.8 kilograms of hashish were seized in Jouf while in the possession of two citizens. Spokesman for the General Directorate of Narcotics Control, Maj. Mohammed Al-Nujaidi, said the suspected smugglers had been arrested and referred to the Public Prosecution. He pointed out that the Ministry of Interior and its various security sectors, in coordination with the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority, continued to target those who tried to sneak drugs into the country and that the latest discovery was part an ongoing crackdown on smuggling networks in the Kingdom. Saudi authorities recently arrested a total of 182 people during operations carried out in several regions of the country. In the Jazan region, security patrols arrested a citizen in the Faifa governorate found with 175 kilograms of khat. Separately, 61 people were held over their suspected involvement in the smuggling of 760 kilograms of hashish and almost 46 tons of khat in the regions of Jazan, Najran, and Asir. Land and sea patrols in the Jazan, Najran, Asir, Jouf, and Tabuk regions also led to the arrest of 120 suspects over their alleged roles in a foiled bid to smuggle 708,910 amphetamine tablets, 136 kilograms of hashish, and almost 801 tons of khat.
