RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s megacity NEOM is preparing to issue tender documents to complete construction work on an infrastructure corridor that will connect its industrial city, OXAGON, with other elements of the $500-billion project, in northwest Saudi Arabia, MEED reported. Also known as NEOM Industrial City, OXAGON was formally launched in November 2021, and will be built around the Duba seaport in the southwest corner of NEOM and will include onshore elements and floating structures offshore. Contractors responded to the prequalification request for the project, known as the NIC Connector, last year, the MEED report stated. The project involves the design and build of a 60-kilometer-long infrastructure corridor running south from The Line at Neom City Station through NEOM Bay Mansions, NEOM Bay airport, and on to OXAGON. The industrial city project aims to promote sustainable energy, autonomous mobility, water innovation, sustainable food production and health and wellbeing. The development also targets technology and digital manufacturing, including telecommunications, space technology and robotics; and modern construction methods. Whereas, bids for a contract to deliver dredging and quay wall works at Duba port, are being prepared for submission by contractors, by July 3, MEED reported. The scope of the package includes excavation and dredging, revetments for channel widening, demolition, container terminal quay expansion and earthworks. It also includes the development of a flexible quay, a roll-on/roll-off berth and quay walls to a marine services berth and a coast guard facility each.
