RIYADH: Qatar Airways will reconsider an initial public offering after the country concludes hosting World Cup 2022 later this year, CEO Akbar Al Baker told Asharq Business. Earlier in 2012, the airline had planned to offer 50 percent stakes in an initial share sale, following three profitable years by the company. However, it had to delay these plans due to regional conditions, which were followed by the COVID-19 pandemic. “If you want to invest your money, you will have to wait until the end of the decade to be able to invest in an IPO of Qatar Airways,” Al Baker said in a news conference without providing further details, according to Reuters.
