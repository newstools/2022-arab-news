RIYADH: British business events firm The Bench is opening a new office in Riyadh, said its general manager in Saudi Arabia, Jana Bader. The company aims to provide a platform for investors in the food and beverage, hospitality, and aviation sectors to connect and share opportunities in the Kingdom. “Our investment conferences focus on deal-making and business development. So, whoever comes to our conferences knows they will be coming out with a return on investment — either a deal being made or a joint venture that is about to take place,” said Bader during an exclusive interview with Arab News at the Future Hospitality Summit in Riyadh. The Bench sees entering the Kingdom as a unique opportunity and wants to hit the targets of Vision 2030 in terms of focusing on the hospitality sector. “Saudi Arabia is the fastest-growing market in the world right now. We are seeing a lot of international investors and brands trying to get into the market,” said Bader. “Now we can help facilitate their entry into the market and create an ecosystem for investors to understand the potential opportunities,” she added. Bader said it is also about helping investors understand Saudi culture. “I do not think we have to separate the Saudi culture from hospitality,” she said. “The Saudi culture is hospitality — it is embedded within the culture, and it’s not something you can disconnect.”
