DUBAI: Education, reskilling and upskilling are driving Saudi Arabia’s future growth as the country currently focuses more on the development of the non-oil sectors, said Sarah Al-Tamimi, deputy president of Human Rights Commission. Speaking at the Top CEO forum in Dubai on Wednesday, Al-Tamimi noted that the human capital development program in Saudi Arabia looks at society as a whole, and it aims to create skilled employees for the future. She also noted that new jobs in multiple sectors are being created in Saudi Arabia regularly, and pointed out that the nation is steadily becoming a manufacturing hub. Al-Tamimi revealed that Saudi Arabia currently has 6,600 small and medium enterprises, and the number is steadily climbing. She added that the unemployment rate in Saudi Arabia is now 11 percent, which the nation wants to bring down to 7 percent.
