RIYADH: Lebanese expatriates in Saudi Arabia will cast their votes on Friday, taking part in their country’s parliamentary elections. Fawzi Kabbara, Lebanon’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia, told Arab News: “The diaspora will vote here at the Lebanese Embassy in the Diplomatic Quarter on May 6. The polling will start at 7 a.m. and will continue till 10 p.m. Special arrangements to successfully complete the voting have been made at the embassy.” There are nearly 9,000 voters who will vote in Riyadh and Dammam, he said, adding: “We have another center for Jeddah, where about 4,500 Lebanese expats will vote. After the polling is completed, the ballot papers will be sent to Beirut and will be counted along with the votes cast in Lebanon on May 15.” Raafat Aoun, a Lebanese expat working in the Kingdom, told Arab News: “The current political situation in Lebanon is decisive and will determine the fate of the country. Because of the monetary and fiscal policies followed for 32 years, Lebanon is in a big predicament. The state is bankrupt because of the quotas, job corruption and policies that have obliterated the middle class, so this stage is delicate, very sensitive.” He added that the people want to take their destiny into their own hands and remove the ruling elite from the government. “The people have discovered that this class has been lying to them with slogans that have led to divisions based on sects and religions. Two weeks are left, and we hope people wake up and make a refreshing change.”
