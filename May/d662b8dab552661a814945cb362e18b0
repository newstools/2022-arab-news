RIYADH: The nutritional department of King Saud Medical City has offered advice to help avoid indigestion during Eid Al-Fitr and after Ramadan. It advised people to make sure that breakfast is light during the opening days of Eid and chew the food sufficiently before swallowing it so that it is properly digested. Therapeutic nutrition expert Noura Al-Feda said that fat in food should be reduced to avoid difficulties in digestion, that moderate amounts of meat should be consumed, while avoiding processed meat and replacing it with fresh meats with little fat. She also recommended reducing the number of sweet treats eaten such as cakes, biscuits and chocolate, as they contain high calories and have low nutritional value. Al-Feda noted the importance of adding more fresh vegetables and fruits to the diet, and ensuring that food is rich in fibers such as whole grains, oats and bran to improve the functioning of the intestines and protect the digestive system. When frequently feeling hungry, the nutritionists recommended eating more regular smaller meals and not eating when you feel full. She added that this will help to ensure a complete and comfortable digestion process to avoid indigestion and heartburn. When eating out, Al-Feda said people should carefully choose safe and reliable food sources. In addition, upon going to a restaurant, she recommended that patrons choose healthy meals that are low in fat and rich in fibers and protein.
