Riyadh Police said they have identified the girl who was seen assaulting another girl in a video that went viral on social media platforms across the country. An investigation is ongoing, and the necessary actions will be taken, a spokesperson for the police department said in a statement.  شرطة منطقة الرياض تُحدِّدُ هوية فتاة ظهرت في مقطع فيديو تعتدي فيه على أخرى في أحد الأماكن العامة pic.twitter.com/qw1IVt0x8W — الأمن العام (@security_gov) May 22, 2022 In the video, a group of girls are seen sitting together when the assailant begins to repeatedly hit the victim on the back of her head in an apparently unprovoked attack. One girl steps in to try to stop the attack while others watch. Dozens of people took to social media on Sunday to call on authorities to reprimand the assailant using the hashtag “Girl bullies her friend” in Arabic. And in a shocking twist a second video has been shared in response to the police tweet which appears to show the same attackers beating a woman in an abaya. In this video the girls - who are wearing the same clothes and have the same physical features repeatedly punch their victim before two other youths appear to come to her rescue.
