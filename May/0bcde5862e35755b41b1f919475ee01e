Arabs often use saffron and cardamom in their traditional dishes as they enjoy the smell and flavor the spices exude.
Today’s recipe is for saffron and cardamom cookies that can be enjoyed with Arabic coffee.
To make the cookies you need 300g plain flour, 200g unsalted butter, 100g caster sugar, 1 tbsp warm milk, 1 tsp ground cardamom and a pinch of saffron and salt. You also need 50g sugar and 1 tsp ground cardamom for dusting.
Soak the saffron in the warm milk for 10 minutes and then stir the milk until it turns a bright orange-yellow color. Dice the butter and gently combine it with sugar using your hands.
In a large bowl, add the milk, butter mix and the other ingredients to the flour and mix well, but not too much — the dough should be flakey, otherwise the cookies will turn out hard.
Roll the dough into a cylindrical shape, wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes before cutting the dough into 2cm-thick discs.
Place a parchment sheet on a baking tray and distribute the cookies. Put the tray in the preheated oven at 180 C and leave it to bake for 12-15 minutes or until the cookies turn a bit golden.
For the dusting mix the ground cardamom with sugar and dust on the baked cookies while they are still hot.
