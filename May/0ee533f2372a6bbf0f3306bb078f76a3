RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s King Salman sent a cable of condolences and sympathy to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on the victims of a terrorist attack that took place east of the Suez Canal on Saturday, the Saudi Press Agency reported early Tuesday.
“As we share with you the pain of this affliction, we send to Your Excellency, the families of the deceased and the Egyptian people, our deepest and sincere condolences,” the king said, reiterating the Kingdom’s stand with Egypt and its people.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also sent a similar cable to the Egyptian president.
The attack in the restive northern part of the Sinai Peninsula killed 11 security personnel of a water pumping station. Five others were wounded in the attack, according to the Egyptian military.
During a meeting of the Supreme Council of the Egyptian Armed Forces on Sunday, President El-Sisi said he has directed law enforcers to cleanse Sinai of terrorist elements.
He stressed the need to continue implementing all security measures that contribute to eliminating terrorism in all its forms.
