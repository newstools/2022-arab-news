Crypto assets have been under pressure over the past one month, mirroring a plunge in equities on fears of aggressive interest rate hikes across the globe to stave off soaring inflation. Amid plummeting cryptocurrency value, Morgan Stanley has warned a decline in global economic growth in 2022, due to the ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the Covid outbreak in China. According to a report from the brokerage, global growth in 2022 will be at 2.9 percent, compared with the 6.2 percent growth seen in 2021. “The deceleration is global, driven by the combination of waning fiscal impetus, tightening monetary policy, a continuing drag from Covid, persistent supply chain frictions, and, most recently, repercussions from the Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Morgan Stanley economists said in a note Tue.10 May.
