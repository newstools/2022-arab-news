MIAMI: As part of the entertainment extravaganza being held in Miami ahead of the city’s Formula One Grand Prix this weekend, sporting legends Tom Brady and Lewis Hamilton have competed in a golf challenge. The seven-time F1 world champion Hamilton teamed up with seven-time Super Bowl winner Brady for the “Big Pilot Challenge” at the Miami Beach Golf Club. The event, organized by Swiss luxury watchmaker IWC Schaffhausen, also brought together retired NFL running back Marcus Allen and Dibia DREAM founder and CEO Brandon Okpalobi. Money raised from the event, which included “longest drive” and “closest to the pin” challenges as well as an IWC watch auction, will go toward social, education and sporting programs in the Miami area. Allen and Okpalobi won the longest drive battle but, while they also won the closest to the pin competition, event host former F1 star David Coulthard declared the event a tie. Practice for the F1 Miami Grand Prix begins on Friday, with qualifying on Saturday and the big race on Sunday.
