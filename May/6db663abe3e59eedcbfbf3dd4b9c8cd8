Severe weather conditions across Germany have left dozens of people injured, with the western region hit by three tornadoes as of Friday. Local authorities cautioned people against venturing outdoors as roofs of some houses were blown off, trees were uprooted and traffic was disrupted, according to various media reports.
Other outlets said the violent storms killed a man in his late thirties and injured more than 40 locals, including women and children. At least 10 were seriously injured, among them a 37-year-old woman who was airlifted to a local hospital to receive medical assistance.
Germany usually experiences tornadoes as colder air from the north collides with the warmer air blowing from the south.
