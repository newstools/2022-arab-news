RIYADH: The Saudi Transport General Authority has reiterated the need for operators of foreign vehicles carrying goods in the Kingdom to adhere to haulage regulations.
In cooperation with several government agencies, the authority polices rules allowing non-Saudi vehicles to transport loads from outside the Kingdom to a specific destination city or back to their country of origin provided a permit has been obtained. The transport of goods between Saudi cities is limited to national carriers.
Clarifying a statement on the issue shared on social media, officials said the authority was keen to support national carriers and establish fair competition, while ensuring that all licensees and operators adhered to laws and regulations.
Since the beginning of this year, control teams had conducted 117 field campaigns to check that licensed facilities were sticking to rules and the authority reported that more than 90 percent of foreign-vehicle operators had been complying.
The Transport Authority aims to regulate services for passengers within and between the cities of the Kingdom.
