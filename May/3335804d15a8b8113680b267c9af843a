RIYADH: Authorities in Saudi Arabia have arrested more than 60 people for attempting to smuggle drugs into the Kingdom, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported on Wednesday. The 61 suspects attempted to smuggle 760 kilograms of hashish and 45.6 tons of the narcotic plant khat in the regions of Jazan, Najran and Asir. Of the 61 suspects, 41 were Saudi citizens, 11 were Ethiopian, seven were Yemeni and two were Pakistani, according to the SPA report. The Kingdom’s authorities continue to crack down on narcotics and smuggling attempts. This included a high-profile ban on the import of fruit and vegetables from Lebanon in 2021 after Saudi Arabia’s Customs thwarted an attempt to smuggle over five million pills of Captagon from the country in fruit items.
