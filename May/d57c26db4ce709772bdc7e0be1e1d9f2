He stressed that the OIC recognizes the importance of preserving the the institutions of marriage and the family, and their central role in social life and achieving sustainable development, ensuring the well-being of society and confronting crises.
The secretary-general urged member states to create an enabling environment to promote and support the family as a contributor to achieving this development, and to work in providing the necessary social, educational and psychological services to families of refugees and displaced persons.
