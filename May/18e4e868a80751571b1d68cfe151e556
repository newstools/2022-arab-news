DUBAI: The Arab World is ready and equipped to welcome women into the business sector, Nora Al Dabal, executive director of Arts and Creative Industries at the Royal Commission for AlUla told Arab News. In an interview with Arab News on the sidelines of the Arab Women Forum in Dubai on May 17, Dabal hailed several initiatives for women that are happening in Saudi Arabia as a part of Vision 2030. “You have so many things that are happening in Saudi, and so many opportunities that both men and women can be part of. And I think if we just remove those barriers and or perceptions, and really see the human that is qualified or not qualified for that position, [that] is what we need to do,” Dabal told Arab News. Dabal also highlighted the necessity of building skills for women to become successful in the world of business. “I think it’s very important to build your skills in general, in whatever specialization you’re in. And I think that takes time and effort,” added Dabal. Talking about RCU’s future plans, Dabal said that the desert accelerator is the first step to Saudi Arabia’s realization of arts within its landscape.
