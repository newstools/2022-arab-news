Memrise is an interactive and personalized language learning website (www.memrise.com) and mobile application available on the App Store and Google Play.
The languages it offers to teach are Spanish (Mexico and Spain), French, Korean, German, Japanese, simplified Chinese, Italian, Turkish, Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal), Russian, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Polish, Danish, and Yoruba.
I am currently using the application to learn French.
After selecting your desired language and level to start (beginner or intermediate), Memrise will show you short clips of people saying the phrase or word for you to repeat after them. And as you go to the next page, the clips will play again and the app asks you to select the text that matches the audio. After that, it will allow you to select its matched translation. For example: Ça va, et toi? — I’m good, and you?
It also trains your ears to pick up the word without relying on subtitles in some videos. I was asked to press a button on the screen whenever I hear the French word for no (non) in one of the beginner videos where a man was speaking casually.
Memrise also teaches you to write the new phrases and words you have learned by showing videos of people saying that certain phrase or word, and you begin typing it.
In the “Immerse” section of the menu bar, you can select listening skills, and practice audio only. It also allows you to vocally respond as if you were speaking to a French local.
In my experience, audio learning is the most effective way to learn a language. Pair that up with conversational practice and you should be speaking a new language in no time! For the latest updates, follow us on Instagram @arabnews.lifestyle
