DUBAI: Ronda Rousey has completed a title victory over long-time rival Charlotte Flair to claim the SmackDown Women’s Championship in an evening of revenge at WrestleMania Backlash.
Following a ferocious start to the “I Quit” match, Rousey took advantage of Flair’s confidence to grab the former champion’s arm, as she screamed “I Quit” and handed Rousey the SmackDown Women’s Title for the first time in her career.
Earlier, Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns teamed up with SmackDown Tag-Team Champions The Usos to underline their dominance over WWE. The Bloodline earned the win against Drew McIntire and Raw Tag-Team Champions RK-Bro in a chaotic match-up that saw the six superstars trade multiple blows before Reigns dealt the final blow to lead The Bloodline to victory once more.
Elsewhere, the returning Cody Rhodes took down Seth Rollins in a close affair, while Edge once again bested AJ Styles thanks to a helping hand from Rhea Ripley, as the two faced off following their dramatic match-up at WrestleMania 38.
