RIYADH: Saudi Arabia has recorded its highest quarterly budget surplus in six years during the first quarter of 2022, amounting to SR57.5 billion ($15.3 billion), the Ministry of Finance announced on Sunday. 
Revenues reached SR278 billion while expenses worth SR220 billion were recorded during the period.   
This is the highest quarterly surplus since the ministry began announcing the budget on a quarterly basis since the beginning of 2016. 
The surplus is attributed to the rising oil prices.
