CAIRO: Egypt condemned Israeli authorities’ intentions to demolish a number of Palestinian villages in the Masafer Yatta area in the occupied West Bank, stressing on Saturday that “such practices undermine the chances of reaching a two-state solution and establishing a comprehensive and just peace in the region.” The Egyptian Foreign Ministry expressed “great concern over the Israeli authorities’ intention to demolish a number of Palestinian villages in the Masafer Yatta area in the occupied West Bank, and the consequent risk of displacing thousands of Palestinians from those villages.” The ministry also affirmed its rejection of reports about the plan to build around 4,000 new settlement units in the occupied Palestinian territories, stressing it represents “a flagrant violation of the rules of international law and the decisions of international legitimacy.” Ambassador Ahmed Hafez, spokesperson for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, affirmed “(the ministry’s) total condemnation of the settlement policy in the Palestinian territories, whether through building new settlements or expanding existing ones, as well as confiscating lands and displacing Palestinians.” He stressed that “continuing such unilateral measures leads to an increase in tension and contributes to fueling the cycle of violence, as it undermines the chances of reaching a two-state solution and establishing comprehensive peace.”
