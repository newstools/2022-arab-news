RIYADH: Japan’s JGC Holdings Corp. said it has been awarded an engineering, procurement, and construction contract by oil giant Saudi Aramco. The deal will see JGC work on the onshore gas-oil separation plant and utility facilities, including water injection. The Zuluf project, which is a giant oil field located in the Arabian Gulf, aims to increase production by around 600,000 barrels per day of Arabian heavy crude. Along with its Saudi subsidiary JGC Arabia, the group will execute work related to the Zuluf central processing facilities, JGC said in a statement, without disclosing the transaction value. “The JGC Group will continue to aim to win orders for projects planned by Saudi Aramco, realizing job creation and technology transfer to many Saudi Arabians through the execution of such projects, thereby contributing to the further development of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” it stated.
