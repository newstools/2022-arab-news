LONDON: UN Special Envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg concluded a two-day meeting with a diverse group of Yemeni public figures on Thursday. The meeting comes as part of Grundberg's consultations with Yemeni groups on the way forward, including their priorities for economic, political, and security paths. Attendees discussed the implementation and extension of the truce, as well as ways to capitalize on the momentum it has created to initiate a comprehensive political dialogue. “This is the time to seize the window of opportunity provided by the truce. Our focus is to ensure the truce is extended for the benefit of Yemeni civilians while making progress on the peace process,” the envoy said. Participants highlighted the need to continue prioritizing improving conditions and the livelihoods of civilians, including by lifting restrictions on the freedom of movement of individuals and commercial goods across the war-torn country. They also highlighted the need to focus on the economy and challenges related to the payment of salaries, bank transfers, discrepancies in exchange rates, and the unification of the Central Bank. Discussions highlighted the need to address the challenges faced by Yemeni women and ensure their meaningful participation in the peace process. The envoy will continue his consultations with diverse Yemeni constituencies, including economic experts, civil society, women’s groups, and political parties during the next few weeks.
