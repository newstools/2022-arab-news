SAN JOSE: On behalf of King Salman, Eng. Waleed Elkhereiji, deputy minister of foreign affairs, attended the presidential inauguration of Rodrigo Chaves in Costa Rica, held in San Jose. The deputy minister conveyed the congratulations and wishes of success of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the president. Saudi Arabia enjoys strong relations with the Central American country. Chaves takes over an economy in decline, with rising foreign debt — about 70 percent of gross domestic product — a poverty rate of 23 percent, unemployment of almost 14 percent and public sector corruption. Vowing to “repair the country,” he said: “We will not just clean house. We will rebuild it!”
