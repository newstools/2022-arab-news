RIYADH: Saudi customs officials on Friday foiled an attempt to smuggle thousands of Captagon tablets into the country. A total of 29,000 of the highly addictive and illegal amphetamine pills were found hidden on a private vessel that had arrived at the port of Al-Haditha. The Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority reported that the drugs had been professionally concealed in plastic disposable gloves placed inside glass cheese containers and then put in the smuggler’s luggage. After seizing the pills, authority staff coordinated with the General Directorate of Narcotics Control in the arrest of a man allegedly waiting to receive the drugs. The Ministry of Interior and its various security sectors, working with the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority, continues to target those trying to sneak drugs into the country and the latest discovery was part of an ongoing crackdown on smuggling networks in the Kingdom. The Saudi government has urged anyone with information related to suspected smuggling operations or customs violations to call the confidential hotline 1910, the international number 00 966 114208417, or email 1910@zatca.gov.sa.
