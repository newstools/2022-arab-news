RIYADH: Radisson Hotel Group is opening its second flagship hotel under its luxury brand Radisson Collection Mansard Riyadh. Elie Milky, the company’s vice president of business development in the Middle East, Pakistan, Cyprus and Greece, told Arab News at the Future Hospitality Summit that Mansard Riyadh will open in the next two weeks. “Radisson Collection is our premium brand. We launched it with Nofa Riyadh a few years ago. It’s a flagship for us. It grows our resort and luxury portfolios in the Kingdom,” said Milky. Located on Prince Mohammed bin Salman Road, Mansard Riyadh will have 140 guestrooms, 27 serviced apartments and 24 three-bedroom villas. “It’s one of our best properties globally, not only in Saudi Arabia,” said Milky. The company is also planning to become carbon negative in the next few years and increase its human capital by opening an office in Saudi Arabia. The company currently operates 25 hotels with 20 more under development in the Kingdom and plans to reach 80 hotels by 2026. Milky added that the company currently generates $150 million in revenue from its hotels and expects to reach $300 million by 2026. “The whole of Saudi Arabia has only 150,000 hotel rooms today. We need to add 450,000 to 500,000 rooms in Saudi Arabia by 2030,” Milky added.
